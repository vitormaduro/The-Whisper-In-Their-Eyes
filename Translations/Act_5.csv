ACT_5_TITLE,ACT FIVE: A Madness,
ACT_5_1.1,"After I tore apart that cursed photo, I broke everything that my fist was capable of breaking.",
ACT_5_1.2,"I broke the table, the ash-tray, the television, the rotary phones, and every glass window I can get my hands on.",
ACT_5_1.3,"By this time, the neighbors should've made a call, complaining of screams coming from a once respectable house, screams that may be ruining their sleep.",
ACT_5_1.4,The neighbors around me were wealthy people as well:,
ACT_5_1.5,"politicians, businessmen, and the general’s press secretary surrounded our house.",
ACT_5_1.6,"It was a house that made Kaede's father almost bankrupt,",
ACT_5_1.7,"and it was only because of my father's reputation, that my father-in-law was even able to secure the ground at half price.",
ACT_5_1.8,"And now it was in ruins from top to bottom, and no police sirens were ringing.",
ACT_5_1.9,"The screams of my agony nearly broke my own throat, and yet, for some reason, they weren't loud enough to break anyone's sleep.",
ACT_5_2.1,"I still remember that I ran around the house, breathing like a madman.",
ACT_5_2.2,"Getting scratches all over my body, chasing voices that weren't there.",
ACT_5_2.3,Trying to kill figures that possessed no shape.,
ACT_5_2.4,"It was all fruitless, for at the end of the day it hurt me more than anything that could've even possibly shared that large space with me, and yet, there was no sight of any living being that I could hurt.",
ACT_5_2.5,"'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,'",
ACT_5_2.6,"I screamed when I broke all the mirrors of the bathroom, and cut myself further on the hand.",
ACT_5_2.7,"My eyes were crying at that point, there was no sight of any whiteness left in my eyes,",
ACT_5_2.8,every strain of it was bleeding...,
ACT_5_3.1,...everything was red.,
ACT_5_4.1,'SHUT UP! SHUT UP!',
ACT_5_5.1,"'SHOW YOURSELF, WHERE ARE YOU?!'",
ACT_5_6.1,"Something suddenly whispered in my ears, and I followed that noise.",
ACT_5_6.2,"Walking among the broken pieces of furniture with their splinters stabbing my legs, I saw a figure, just at the corner of the upper stairs bathroom.",
ACT_5_7.1,"As soon as I reached the edge of that room, that figure disappeared down the stairs.",
ACT_5_7.2,"My eyes could not make out that shape, but something blurry did walk by downstairs.",
ACT_5_7.3,"I bit my shard stabbed hand with my mouth, and wounds that were starting to heal opened up again.",
ACT_5_7.4,"If I was to hurt whatever walked beneath these stairs,",
ACT_5_7.5,I was making sure that it would taste the blood that it had made me spill.,
ACT_5_8.1,'I SEE YOU!',
ACT_5_9.1,"'I SEE YOU, YOU LITTLE SHIT!'",
ACT_5_10.1,It was floating away like wind from my sight.,
ACT_5_10.2,"Now it stood at the edge of the room, and with a blink of my eye, it was gone.",
ACT_5_10.3,"I ran where it stood before, and yet, turned my head left and saw nothing.",
ACT_5_10.4,'WHERE ARE YOU!',
ACT_5_10.5,I screamed at the top of my lungs and punched the wall near me.,
ACT_5_10.6,"I was not letting this fucker get away from me, it would pay what it had done, and I was going to make sure that it suffered when it paid.",
ACT_5_10.7,"I will make sure that whoever he ever loved, and whomever he ever even touched would die with the same suffering that thing caused me.",
ACT_5_10.8,I was not letting it get away from my sight.,
ACT_5_11.1,"I was staring at the direction that noise came from, and yet I cannot make out a figure.",
ACT_5_12.1,"I turned my head around, and it was there, standing just right at the end of the hallway.",
ACT_5_12.2,"I still cannot make out its face, but I could tell, oh I could tell that he was taking pleasure in my misery.",
ACT_5_12.3,LAUGHING!,
ACT_5_12.4,SMILING!,
ACT_5_12.5,I would like to see how that thing smiled when I ripped its skin apart in two.,
ACT_5_12.6,I would like to hear its scream...,
ACT_5_12.7,HA.,
ACT_5_12.8,HA....,
ACT_5_12.9,I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ITS SCREAM WHEN I TORE ITS THROAT WITH MY BARE TEETH.,
ACT_5_13.1,'GET BACK HERE YOU...',
ACT_5_14.1,The lights flickered and that figure disappeared.,
ACT_5_14.2,"'No, no, no,'",
ACT_5_14.3,"I punched the wall again, and the shard deepened in my knuckles.",
ACT_5_14.4,"The wound opened further, and as my hand was up in the air trying to grab whatever was nearby to destroy or mutilate, that blood trickled all the way up my arm and almost covered my shoulder,",
ACT_5_14.5,until I let my arms down.,
ACT_5_15.1,'COFF! COFF!',
ACT_5_15.2,"My lungs contracted, and staring down at the ground,",
ACT_5_15.3,I violently started coughing out whatever was inside my body.,
ACT_5_16.1,And inside my body were shards and shards of glass covered in blood.,
ACT_5_16.2,All of them reflecting red.,
ACT_5_16.3,"My red eyes looked pleasant in them, for then I was able to create a certain disbelief that my eyes were normal,",
ACT_5_16.4,that I was still sane....,
ACT_5_16.5,that was the wrong disbelief to have as I found out not just a minute later.,
ACT_5_17.1,"'AAAAAAAAAAAAAA',",
ACT_5_17.2,"The scream escaped me with a splatter of blood,",
ACT_5_17.3,"'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA',",
ACT_5_17.4,"it almost felt like my chest was tearing in two, I could already feel the layers of and layers of tangled nerves snapping and unfolding.",
ACT_5_17.5,'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA',
ACT_5_17.6,"my head shook with every instance of that scream, at points I could not tell whether it was there or not, or it was just blown away eons ago.",
ACT_5_17.7,"The brain had rotted from inside, I know...",
ACT_5_17.8,I can tell.,
ACT_5_17.9,"It was my brain, and",
ACT_5_17.10,I was smelling the smell of my own organs burning.,
ACT_5_17.11,[i]Drip[/i].,
ACT_5_17.12,[i]Drip[/i].,
ACT_5_17.13,[i]Drip[/i].,
ACT_5_17.14,More blood dripped from knuckles.,
ACT_5_18.1,"I suddenly found myself muttering,",
ACT_5_18.2,"'I want this blood back, it's mine!'",
ACT_5_18.3,"and without knowing I put my own bleeding hand in my mouth, and slurped up the blood that was dripping from it.",
ACT_5_19.1,'COFF! COFF!' I coughed out my own blood.,
ACT_5_19.2,WHY DID I COUGHED OUT MY OWN FUCKING BLOOD!,
ACT_5_19.3,IT IS MY BLOOD!,

ACT_5_19.18,NOW!,
ACT_5_20.1,"I coughed up my own,",
ACT_5_20.2,MY VERY OWN blood.,
ACT_5_20.3,Why was it not going inside my body?,
ACT_5_20.4,Why did it had to fucking bleed out to the ground?,
ACT_5_20.5,It looked so ugly down there.,
ACT_5_20.6,My reflection looked malicious in it.,
ACT_5_20.7,"I am not malicious, I am just a guy trying to live a normal life, and yet, that innocent guy, in its reflection, looked so ugly, so malevolent, so dangerous, and...",
ACT_5_21.1,SO VIOLENT.,
ACT_5_22.1,"I looked it up, and saw that it was standing just there, where I had first seen it.",
ACT_5_22.2,'You!',
ACT_5_22.3,"I grunted, and walked with limping steps,",
ACT_5_22.4,'You FUCKING...echa...ack....',
ACT_5_22.5,"I was choking on my own words, but my eyes did not flicker even for a single second.",
ACT_5_22.6,"They were wide open, staring intently at that at the very edge of the hallway.",
ACT_5_22.7,"I would not blink on my own, until that thing was blinking no more.",
ACT_5_23.1,"As I limped further and further towards my goal, the voices in my head got louder and louder.",
ACT_5_23.2,"Trickling down the ground, I left footprints on the red substance that fell from grace out of my body.",
ACT_5_23.3,"I was going to make sure that when I cornered it, I will make up for it by drinking the blood of that monster.",
ACT_5_24.1,'GET BACK HERE!,
ACT_5_24.2,I GOTTA KILL YOU!,
ACT_5_24.3,LET ME KILL YOU!,

ACT_5_24.5,YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE CAUSED!,
ACT_5_24.6,COME QUICK AND I WILL MAKE IT QUICK!',
ACT_5_24.7,"Those words were empty, I had already made up my mind that whatever was about to happen, was definitely not going to be quick.",
ACT_5_25.1,"I was back in that room, back in that wretched room where they had taken my Kaede from me.",
ACT_5_25.2,I was not gonna let it slide.,
ACT_5_26.1,I believe you!,
ACT_5_26.2,"Yes, You!",
ACT_5_26.3,"The one I narrate my tale to can see the room, can't you?",
ACT_5_26.4,"Then tell me, do you see its walls breath,",
ACT_5_26.5,because I did.,
ACT_5_26.6,"I saw each of the walls expand to almost unnatural size, and with them they carried a sound of breathing.",
ACT_5_26.7,"It would expand so much that I could make out its wallpaper stretching beyond its breaking point, and as I would stare at them, I would realize that these were no normal walls....",
ACT_5_26.8,"they were live skin, and that I was somehow ....",
ACT_5_27.1,...at the mouth of the beast.,
ACT_5_28.1,"The voice returned, and it whispered near the other door of the room.",
ACT_5_28.2,I closed my eyes and followed...,
ACT_5_29.1,"...and quickly opened the door, without trying to open my eyes even once, and when I finally did, I was standing in that hall again.",
ACT_5_29.2,"That hall, opened to the other door of the ROOM.",
ACT_5_29.3,NOT THIS DOOR!,
ACT_5_29.4,How was I back in that hall!,
ACT_5_30.1,"WAIT,",
ACT_5_30.2,WHEN DID YOUR HOUSE HAD A GIANT HALL?,
ACT_5_31.1,I turned around and opened back that door...,
ACT_5_32.1,...and somehow exited into my....my....,
ACT_5_33.1,...office.,
ACT_5_34.1,"It was just like how I had left it, but it was.......",
ACT_5_34.2,impossible.,
ACT_5_35.1,The walls...,
ACT_5_36.1,They started breathing again.,
ACT_5_37.1,"They were expanding again,",
ACT_5_37.2,"and falling again,",
ACT_5_37.3,"and expanding,",
ACT_5_37.4,"and falling,",
ACT_5_37.5,"and expanding,",
ACT_5_37.6,"and falling,",
ACT_5_37.7,"and expanding,",
ACT_5_37.8,"and falling,",
ACT_5_37.9,"and expanding,",
ACT_5_37.10,and falling....,
ACT_5_38.1,My hair flew up in the air.,
ACT_5_38.2,"Something was breathing behind me again, I turned around, but there was nothing.",
ACT_5_39.1,They flew again.,
ACT_5_39.2,AGAIN!,
ACT_5_39.3,"But nothing was behind me, AGAIN!",
ACT_5_39.4,That breath!,
ACT_5_39.5,It was cold...,
ACT_5_39.6,"cold as ice,",
ACT_5_39.7,and it froze the back of my head every time it came.,
ACT_5_39.8,"That cold was not gentle either,",
ACT_5_39.9,it pierced like needles through my skull.,
ACT_5_39.10,I did not wish for it once more...,
ACT_5_40.1,"'AAAAAA',",
ACT_5_40.2,I staggered away from the place where I was standing.,
ACT_5_40.3,"This breath was unbearable, and this breathing room,",
ACT_5_40.4,it was,
ACT_5_40.5,an eyesore!,
ACT_5_41.1,Can you see it?,
ACT_5_41.2,"At the corner of the room,",
ACT_5_41.3,"just there,",
ACT_5_41.4,"where the two walls met,",
ACT_5_41.5,stood a half dead body.,
ACT_5_41.6,"It had skin on one end, and nothing but splattered flesh on the other.",
ACT_5_41.7,"It was cut in half, with a perfect symmetry, and its red blood was drooling all over the wall.",
ACT_5_41.8,"You want to know something funny,",
ACT_5_41.9,if you just....,
ACT_5_41.10,"just tilt your head sideways,",
ACT_5_41.11,you could see that this half-chewed body resembled that of a half-an-open mouth.,
ACT_5_41.12,"The body that was left, it was molded and broken into a shape that resembled a lip, the few broken pieces of its skeleton that popped out of that cut apart skin, were broken into so many cracks that they resembled the upper teeth.",
ACT_5_42.1,However...,
ACT_5_43.1,...there was no lower jaw.,
ACT_5_43.2,NO LOWER JAW.,
ACT_5_43.3,ONLY MEAT!,
ACT_5_43.4,"RED,",
ACT_5_43.5,"DIRTY,",
ACT_5_43.6,"SPILLED,",
ACT_5_43.7,ROTTEN MEAT ALL OVER THE WALLS!,
ACT_5_43.8,"And you want to know the worst part of it,",
ACT_5_43.9,that dead piece of flesh....,
ACT_5_44.1,...,
ACT_5_45.1,.....,
ACT_5_46.1,.......,
ACT_5_47.1,...was breathing.,
ACT_5_48.1,"YOU CAN SEE IT,",
ACT_5_48.2,CAN'T YOU!,
ACT_5_48.3,PLEASE TELL ME YOU CAN!,
ACT_5_48.4,FOR IT IS THE MOST HORRIBLE SIGHT THAT CAN BEFELL ANY LIVING BEING'S EYES!,
ACT_5_49.1,"I closed my eyes, and followed that voice again...",
ACT_5_50.1,...and when I opened my eyes...,
ACT_5_51.1,I was in my living room.,
ACT_5_52.1,It was painful...,
ACT_5_52.2,"so,",
ACT_5_52.3,"so,",
ACT_5_52.4,painful to hear all these voices.,
ACT_5_52.5,"I did not wish to stand here anymore, and yet I cannot see an exit.",
ACT_5_52.6,"My head was hot,",
ACT_5_52.7,"my body was hot,",
ACT_5_52.8,everything was burning.,
ACT_5_52.9,"The cold breaths when they came,",
ACT_5_52.10,"they pierced through my skull,",
ACT_5_52.11,"and these voices,",
ACT_5_52.12,"THESE FUCKING VOICES,",
ACT_5_52.13,they won't stop.,
ACT_5_52.14,THEY JUST WON'T STOP!,
ACT_5_53.1,And as I laid there in pain and agony...,
ACT_5_53.2,I wished...,
ACT_5_53.3,I could only wish that whatever was happening was just a figment of my mind.,
ACT_5_53.4,That it was just happening in my brain.,
ACT_5_53.5,"That I will soon open my eyes, and wake up to a world that was",
ACT_5_53.6,NORMAL.,
ACT_5_54.1,"However, I was coughing blood from my throat, and bleeding from my hand.",
ACT_5_54.2,"And as I stared at those two gulps of red that flow from my body,",
ACT_5_54.3,I knew...,
ACT_5_54.4,I very well knew....,
ACT_5_55.1,...that this was no dream....,
ACT_5_56.1,....that this was no figment of my imagination....,
ACT_5_57.1,...that this was....this was...,
ACT_5_58.1,...all really happening to me....and it was happening...,
ACT_5_59.1,...right in the real world.,
ACT_5_60.1,"I knew that following the voice spelled doom, but there was nothing else I could do.",
ACT_5_60.2,All I could do was follow and open the front door...,
ACT_5_61.1,...knowing very well...,
ACT_5_62.1,...that whatever I would escape into...,
ACT_5_63.1,...was not going to be the outside world.,
ACT_5_64.1,I was back in that room.,
ACT_5_64.2,It made no sense.,
ACT_5_64.3,"The front door was nowhere near my bedroom, then how come that I was back in it.",
ACT_5_64.4,I wanted to ask so many questions but...,
ACT_5_65.1,...those breathing walls had my attention.,
ACT_5_65.2,"Now whenever I saw them stretch far and far away, I would see shadows of the bodies trapped inside.",
ACT_5_65.3,They were clinging at the skin of the walls that trapped them.,
ACT_5_65.4,"My shoulders lost all the powers that they once possessed, and I fell down on my knees.",
ACT_5_65.5,'COFF!,
ACT_5_65.6,COFF!',
ACT_5_65.7,"Whatever coughed, it wasn't me.",
ACT_5_66.1,Cackle.,
ACT_5_66.2,Cackle.,
ACT_5_66.3,They all were cackling around me like crows.,
ACT_5_66.4,Why do crows cackle you ask?,
ACT_5_67.1,"Well, they are attracted to the smell of death,",
ACT_5_67.2,"and smell of flesh,",
ACT_5_67.3,and smell of anything that bled.,
ACT_5_67.4,"I bled from top to bottom,",
ACT_5_67.5,and I was a dying one.,
ACT_5_67.6,"My body was rotting,",
ACT_5_67.7,"that once stable flesh,",
ACT_5_67.8,"dissolving into nothing but a pulp of chewed organs,",
ACT_5_67.9,"torn skin,",
ACT_5_67.10,and an overflowed pool of blood.,
ACT_5_67.11,I wonder.,
ACT_5_67.12,Ha.,
ACT_5_67.13,Ha.,
ACT_5_67.14,"I wonder when they rip me apart, what they will do with my intestines?",
ACT_5_67.15,Would they eat it last or eat it first?,
ACT_5_67.16,Or would they spread it out wide in a showcase of modern art:,
ACT_5_67.17,[i]wrapped around my skin like a fish caught in a net.[/i],
ACT_5_68.1,I was out of playing that game.,
ACT_5_68.2,I wanted whatever it was to just show itself and be done with me.,
ACT_5_68.3,"I was already dying, I wanted to get out of this.",
ACT_5_68.4,"I wanted to die, if I could prick those shards out of my knuckles and cut my wrist in two,",
ACT_5_68.5,I would.,
ACT_5_68.6,"But I was shaking and bleeding already, my mind had lost all its sense of place.",

ACT_5_74.1,'Something spoke not from left...,
ACT_5_74.2,not from right...,
ACT_5_74.3,not from behind...,
ACT_5_74.4,and definitely not in the front. Neither was it something that was below me.,
ACT_5_74.5,It was something that spoke from...,
ACT_5_75.1,...above.,
ACT_5_76.1,"Have you ever seen something so vicious and angry, so terrifyingly bigger than you, that you cannot describe the fear you felt, all just by looking at it.",
ACT_5_76.2,"A figure so inhuman,",
ACT_5_76.3,"so detached from the sense of structure,",
ACT_5_76.4,"so horrible in the way it drooled and breathed,",
ACT_5_76.5,"and so unspeakably mysterious in its movement,",
ACT_5_76.6,"that all you can do,",
ACT_5_76.7,"is describe,",
ACT_5_76.8,is its movement.,
ACT_5_76.9,"The moment when you look at that thing,",
ACT_5_76.10,knowing that it is approaching...,
ACT_5_77.1,"...little by little towards you, with limbs that bended in usual directions,",
ACT_5_77.2,"slogging the body that they were attached to,",
ACT_5_77.3,"and yet,",
ACT_5_77.4,"the movement was so smooth,",
ACT_5_77.5,"that you can tell,",
ACT_5_77.6,"that this unspeakable horror that your eyes shook to,",
ACT_5_77.7,"your legs surrendered to,",
ACT_5_77.8,"you knees shook so much in fear that they touched each other,",
ACT_5_77.9,and your mind struggled against the friction of sanity that struck in a total different direction of comprehensibility,
ACT_5_77.10,"and the resulting spark started a fire which burned every nerve that was so long holding together your being of existence,",
ACT_5_77.11,WAS MOVING ITS NATURAL MOVEMENTS.,
ACT_5_77.12,"It was born this way, this was its natural form, and it was ready to devour whatever was below it.",

ACT_5_78.2,Ha.,
ACT_5_78.3,Ha.,
ACT_5_79.1,All I could do...,
ACT_5_79.2,was to wish that it would not hurt for long.,
ACT_5_80.1,But I knew that privilege was not afford to me.,
ACT_5_80.2,For the way it moved closer,
ACT_5_80.3,and closer,
ACT_5_80.4,and closer...,
ACT_5_81.1,...it made itself clear...,
ACT_5_82.1,...that it was going to hurt me...,
ACT_5_83.1,...and...,
ACT_5_84.1,...it would be painful...,
ACT_5_85.1,...very...,
ACT_5_86.1,...very...,
ACT_5_87.1,....painful.,
ACT_5_88.1,And I guess that is how I ended here.,
ACT_5_88.2,That is the injustice that was carried out to me and the ones I loved so dearly.,
ACT_5_88.3,"I can only wish that I could rant like I did in the beginning of our conversation, but the truth is, I don’t feel anything anymore now that I have told my tale.",
ACT_5_88.4,"Still, this is not the conclusion of the tale,",
ACT_5_88.5,"there is still one missing piece,",
ACT_5_88.6,and it's not for me to narrate.,
ACT_5_88.7,"I am sorry to leave you now to whatever conclusion you are about to see,",
ACT_5_88.8,"but it is getting cold in this, dark, dark, place.",
ACT_5_88.9,"I cannot find a warmer one, and so, I shall move to find it.",
ACT_5_88.10,"Till then, whatever revelations await you, is not for me to see.",
ACT_5_88.11,I am....,
ACT_5_88.12,"I am not even in the same condition I met you earlier,",
ACT_5_88.13,"it is getting terrible,",
ACT_5_88.14,terrible for me to keep track of what is happening anymore.,
ACT_5_88.15,"I remember that I welcomed you to something,",
ACT_5_88.16,"to somewhere I once knew,",
ACT_5_88.17,but that place...,
ACT_5_89.1,...it was not as dark as this one.,
ACT_5_89.2,"I can assure you,",
ACT_5_89.3,"I remember it was brightly lit,",
ACT_5_89.4,"and brightly colored,",
ACT_5_89.5,and everyone...,
ACT_5_89.6,EVERYONE,
ACT_5_89.7,was happy.,
ACT_5_90.1,I must go.,
ACT_5_90.2,I must go.,
ACT_5_90.3,I cannot stay here anymore.,
ACT_5_90.4,"Goodbye from my end, and in case whatever you learn next, good, bad, or even mildly interesting, do not tell me if I loop around back to you.",
ACT_5_90.5,I just wish to find something warm.,
ACT_5_91.1,"Goodbye, and in case we meet again, please do me a favor, as told before, do not tell me what you learn next and...",
ACT_5_92.1,"...do not forget my name, because the last thing I want",
ACT_5_92.2,is to be forgotten.,
