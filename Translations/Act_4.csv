ACT_4_1.3,"It was black and blurry, I could not make out the shape of it, nor its volume or face.","Era preta e borrada, eu não conseguia reconhecer a forma dela, nem seu volume ou face"
ACT_4_1.4,"All I knew was that it was blurry, slower than what movements should be.","Tudo o que eu sabia é que ela era borrada, mais lenta do que movimentos deveriam ser"
ACT_4_1.5,"I remember I once saw a cartoon footage in the training camp, it was about this animation of a dragon in an army uniform, telling you how to take care of your rifle. In the end, real life and cartoon mixed, for the great leader appeared by the dragon's side, and gave his approval to the message. I remember then the projector reel had broken down, and everything in the picture was moving slowly,","Eu lembro que uma vez vi um desenho animado no campo de treinamento, era sobre uma animação de dragão em uniforme de exército, te dizendo como cuidar do seu rifle. No final, a vida real e o desenho se misturaram, pois o grande líder apareceu ao lado do dragão, e deu sua aprovação à mensagem. Eu lembro que a bobina do projetor havia quebrado, e tudo no vídeo estava se movendo devagar,"
ACT_4_1.6,very slowly.,muito devagar.
ACT_4_1.7,"It was blurry, and it was burning, and there I saw it, an unimaginable movement that was neither so slow that it felt like you were seeing just one image after another, neither as fast as a regular footage should look.","Era borrado, e estava queimando, e alí eu vi, um movimento inimaginável que não era nem lento demais para ser uma imagem após a outra, e nem rápido como um vídeo normal."

ACT_4_1.12,"For I fear that whenever I would do so, that figure would blur in front of me, and it would soon grow and expand, until it would engulf me, and I would be consumed","Pois eu temia que se eu o fizesse, aquela figura se borraria na minha frente, e ela logo cresceria e se expandiria, até me engolir, e eu seria consumido"
ACT_4_1.13,into unknown darkness...,por uma escuridão desconhecida...
ACT_4_2.1,"It didn't happen then,","Não aconteceu naquela época,"
ACT_4_2.2,"for I woke up normally one day, forgetting what I was even scared about.","Pois eu acordei normalmente um dia, esquecendo-me do que eu estava com medo."
ACT_4_2.3,"I was a good soldier liked by every person who trained with me, and so many vouched for me. That was the closest I ever felt that I would never serve my nation,","Eu era um bom soldado apreciado por todos que treinavam comigo, e muitos ficaram ao meu lado. Aquilo foi o mais próximo que eu já senti de que eu nunca serviria minha nação,"
ACT_4_2.4,"except for that, I made sure to never let any sign of weakness show.","exceto por aquilo, eu garanti que nunca mostrasse nenhum sinal de fraqueza."
ACT_4_2.5,"I had that in me, and I should've had a subconscious that should be able to fight this fear.","Aquilo era parte de mim, e eu deveria ter um subconsciente capaz de lutar contra esse medo."

ACT_4_3.3,I wanted to beg.,Eu quis implorar.
ACT_4_3.4,"I wanted to scream for it to not expand, to not engulf me, and let me live.","Eu quis gritar para ela não se expandir, não me engolir, e me deixar viver."
ACT_4_3.5,"I wanted to bargain with it, wanted to give it anything that it desired, but it felt like the only thing it wanted was....","Eu quis barganhar com ela, queria dá-la tudo o que ela desejasse, mas parecia que tudo o que ela queria era...."

ACT_4_5.3,coughing my heart out.,Tussindo com todas as minhas forças

ACT_4_6.1,'Kaede...','Kaede...'
ACT_4_6.2,"I turned my gaze to where she was supposed to be sleeping, and though the bed sheet had enough wrinkles to tell that something once slept there, and even struggled left and right, and that something was not here anymore.","Eu virei meu olhar para onde ela deveria estar dormindo, e apesar de o lençol estar bagunçado o suficiente para mostrar que alguém dormiu ali, e até se virou de um lado para o outro, e que algo não estava mais lá."
ACT_4_7.1,'Kaede!','Kaede!'
ACT_4_7.2,"I lightly said her name, wishing she was somewhere nearby, having just woken up to get a glass of water, or maybe...","Eu suavemente disse seu nome, desejando que ela estivesse em algum lugar próximo, tendo apenas acordado para pegar um copo d'água, ou talvez..."

ACT_4_9.6,"I screamed her name again and went back into the bedroom, but she was still not there.","Eu gritei seu nome novamente e voltei ao quarto, mas ela ainda não estava lá."
ACT_4_9.7,"I hoped that maybe we just missed each other, maybe she went to get a glass of water and when I was checking in the bathroom she would show up back and ask what was all the fuss about.","Eu esperava que talvez só nós tivessemos nos desencontrado, talvez ela tenha ido pegar um copo d'água e enquanto eu estava checando o banheiro ela apareceria e perguntaria que barulheira era aquela."
ACT_4_10.1,"But nothing like that was happening, she was still not present at the place she needed to be, I rushed over to the bed and sat there for a while.","Mas nada assim aconteceu, ela ainda não estava presente no lugar que precisava estar, eu corri até a cama e sentei nela por um tempo."

ACT_4_12.2,but that point was not now.,mas esse não era o ponto agora.

ACT_4_12.7,"Seiko had shown me its photo, and it was such a serene looking place, especially when the moonlight fell blue into the room, it felt like all celestial beings were just neighboring your house, staring at the beauty of the place so white, that they were surprised that it wasn't covered in snow.","Seiko havia me mostrado uma foto, e era um lugar tão serene, especialmente quando o luar banhava o quarto de azul, parecia que os seres celestiais moravam ao lado da sua casa, encarando a beleza do lugar tão branco, que eles se surpreendiam por não estar coberto de neve."
ACT_4_12.8,I bet...,Aposto...
ACT_4_12.9,"oh I bet,","Ah eu aposto,"

ACT_4_15.3,"Again, she was not behind me. I was getting impatient at this point, my breathing became more rapid in anticipation, and the heart was to follow its lead and pump harder.","Novamente, ela não estava atrás de mim. Eu estava ficando impaciente, minha respiração acelerando de antecipação, e o coração seguia sua deixa e bombeava com mais força"
