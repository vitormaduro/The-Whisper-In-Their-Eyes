ACT_2_TITLE,[color=black][center]ACT TWO: A Photograph[/center][/color],
>>>>>>> 25-act-2
ACT_2_1.1,"When I boarded the train home, I was accompanied by two officers as an escort.",
ACT_2_1.2,"Times remained tough despite the successful victory at [i]Ufana[/i], and there was still a chance that any military officer, especially the head of any department was at risk of being shot.",
ACT_2_1.3,Protests from [i]Conferri[/i] people were still appearing all over the country.,
ACT_2_1.4,"A billionaire [i]Yhafanian[/i] even spoke out against the entire [i]Yhafian[/i] government, blaming them for inhuman acts of violence.",
ACT_2_1.5,"From what I heard, three days of confinement in his hotel room and negotiations regarding his trade routes was enough for him to publicly apologize for his comments.\n\n",
ACT_2_1.6,"I tried requesting if I could go in a civilian dress, just so I could avoid said pitfalls, but the general was adamant that none of the men working under his command were to hide their identity as a man of force, no matter how tough the situation was.",
ACT_2_1.7,"For the uniform carried a pride in it,",
ACT_2_1.8,and that pride was not to be discarded even during times of crisis.,
ACT_2_2.1,"I did not care about my pride to be honest, all I wanted to do was to get home…",
ACT_2_3.1,...to her.,
ACT_2_4.1,"It was a 14 hour train ride, during which I slept in an Air-conditioned coach, where on random intervals, me and the two men accompanying me got saluted by three civilian men.",
ACT_2_4.2,"I do not remember their appearance, for all their faces just melted into one for me after a while, but I remember that one of them had a boy with him, and the father had told all of us that he wished for his 16-year-old son to be like us.",
ACT_2_4.3,"He probably didn't know the army’s ranks, duties, and how they worked, for he didn't know by looking at the shoulder-pins that the two around me were the actual men of field, and to whom he said,",
ACT_2_4.4,"'I wish he could be a warrior like you,'",
ACT_2_4.5,with an excited face was just a man doing desk job.\n\n,
ACT_2_4.6,"I remember the son had moved, and attempted his best salute.",
ACT_2_4.7,"It was then and there, that I and the two men accompanying me knew that he would never be a warrior.",
ACT_2_4.8,"His hand salute was shaky,",
ACT_2_4.9,"his legs were basically noodles,",
ACT_2_4.10,but worst of all...,
ACT_2_5.1,...his knees touched.,
ACT_2_6.1,"I wish I could say that my sleep was pleasant during the night, but you know by now that it probably wasn't.",
ACT_2_7.1,"After the incident with the pregnant girl, I hadn't picked up the phone or been called by Rikki or anyone for the next few hours.",
ACT_2_7.2,"I believe I had a good three hours of sleep, from which Seiko woke me up again to tell me that there was a call from Rikki.",
ACT_2_7.3,"I had picked up the call and Rikki had given me strict instructions, telling me that...",
ACT_2_8.1,"...that I needed to stay quiet about this event,",
ACT_2_8.2,even to my wife.,
ACT_2_8.3,"The plan was always to bury the dead bodies out of sight, in a forest.",
ACT_2_8.4,"However, the death of Ginta and the officer who shot him, had made things complicated.",
ACT_2_8.5,"A new story was to be concocted, and fast.\n\n",
ACT_2_8.6,"Two hours later, Rikki had called me with the exact story I needed to parrot to everyone around me, including recording it in the official documents and forwarding it  to be simplified for the press.\n\n",
ACT_2_8.7,The story was this:,
ACT_2_8.8,"the officer who shot Ginta, officer Yuu Yamazaki, was secretly either a mole or a traitor informant, implanted by the nation of [i]Sutwandra[/i]. His family in [i]Onkawa[/i] prefecture near [i]Hijaresta[/i] was already arrested, including his wife, his old mother, and his two teenage daughters, all of whom were to be trialed in court",
ACT_2_8.9,as adults.,
ACT_2_9.1,"Officer Ginta, was to be honored as a hero,",
ACT_2_9.2,"who saved lives of everyone in Rikki’s division by engaging and successfully stopping Yuu from releasing a hand-grenade, but in the scuffle got his head blown off by Yuu's shotgun.",
ACT_2_9.3,"The general had given a personal apology to his family by writing a letter from his own hands, or at least that’s how the story was to be told. Knowing the general, he probably had it typed by one of the clerks, and just had his stamp put on it.\n\n",
ACT_2_9.4,"Anyway, by the time I woke up, I am pretty sure that 45 year old Ginta's 16 year old wife and 60 years old mother would have gotten his ashes and uniform.",
ACT_2_10.1,'Can you hand me the newspaper?',
ACT_2_10.2,"I had asked one of the officers upon waking up, and had ordered the other one to get me some pouched milk from then current stop, [i]Togamare[/i].",
ACT_2_10.3,"The train usually stopped for half-an-hour there, and when I woke up, it was only ten minutes into its stop.",
ACT_2_10.4,"The man returned in five minutes with my pouched milk, and brought himself and the other soldiers some cheap cold beer.\n\n",
ACT_2_10.5,The train won't move from the station for the next forty-five minutes.,
ACT_2_10.6,"For some [i]Yhafanian[/i] people, mostly young men, who were sympathetic to the [i]Conferri[/i] people, had sat in-front of the railway tracks, protesting the attacks.",
ACT_2_10.7,"After negotiations had fallen short, tear gas had been applied. Then things played out as usual:",
ACT_2_10.8,"[i]some were beaten with sticks,[/i]",
ACT_2_10.9,"[i]some ran away,[/i]",
ACT_2_10.10,"[i]some went missing,[/i]",
ACT_2_10.11,[i]and most were arrested as an example.[/i],
ACT_2_11.1,"At one point, an annoying fly was buzzing around my ears.",
ACT_2_11.2,"There were moments that I thought it was buzzing at my left ear,",
ACT_2_11.3,"then there were moments where I thought it was buzzing at my right ear,",
ACT_2_11.4,"and in that confusion of left and right buzzing, I kept waving my hands to make the fly go away.",
ACT_2_11.5,"I finally saw the fly when it was just above me,",
ACT_2_11.6,and there...,
ACT_2_12.1,...I finally killed it.,
ACT_2_12.2,Its blood splattered on my hands.,
ACT_2_13.1,"Anyway, about the newspaper I was handed.",
ACT_2_13.2,"The front page was as expected, a victory celebration of [i]Yhafain[/i] army successfully suppressing any uprising.",
ACT_2_13.3,"One of the leaders of the [i]Conferri[/i] student union gave a public speech apologizing for his actions, and condemning the [i]Conferri[/i] protests, declaring that it was not until the respect that [i]Yhafa[/i]'s army provided to him during his confinement that he came to a realization that he too was a [i]Yhafian[/i], and that calling himself [i]Conferri[/i] was dividing our people against each other.\n\n",
ACT_2_13.4,"When asked about his swollen right eye,",
ACT_2_13.5,"knife cuts to the neck,",
ACT_2_13.6,"broken and burnt fingers,",
ACT_2_13.7,"and a disjointed jaw,",
ACT_2_13.8,he claimed that he got all those scars and bruises when the crowd started panicking from the blasts that his own rebellion carried out.,
ACT_2_13.9,"During said panic, he got stomped by the running crowd from which he was rescued by one of [i]Yhafa[/i]'s brave men. Hence, he started to question his belief and had a change of heart.",
ACT_2_14.1,Reading that I was confused.,
ACT_2_14.2,Did his heart changed during confinement or being rescued from the stomping of the crowd?,
ACT_2_15.1,"While I was reading the newspaper, the soldier suddenly took out a berry from his left pocket, and a switchblade knife from his right.",
ACT_2_15.2,"Then snapping the knife open, he brought the blade just in between the berry and soon,",
ACT_2_15.3,"it was cut in half,",
ACT_2_15.4,"with a perfect symmetry,",
ACT_2_15.5,and its red juice was flowing all over his hand.\n\n,
ACT_2_15.6,"He reached that hand out to me and asked,",
ACT_2_15.7,'Do you want one sir?'\n\n,
ACT_2_15.8,I shook my head and refused.,
ACT_2_15.9,"It looked like he was just waiting for me to say no, for he popped both of them in his mouth with a perfect throw.",
ACT_2_16.1,"I had turned the papers over and over again, searching if there was something about the pregnant girl and her friends, but I found nothing but an eulogy to Ginta.",
ACT_2_16.2,"His bravery was written in large bold words, including Yuu's betrayal to his country.",
ACT_2_16.3,"Looked like they went with the traitor story instead of the spy story, as it was much easier to concoct. On top was Ginta's model-like beautiful face in a giant photo, with his name written under it, carried by a prefix of the word 'Brave'.",
ACT_2_16.4,"On bottom, were the photos of Yuu and his family.",
ACT_2_16.5,"Not gonna lie, they were an ugly bunch, including his daughters. My mind wondered what if I was married to one of these ugly looking things, though a reassurance came to me, telling me that...",
ACT_2_17.1,...that all went well for me.,
ACT_2_18.1,"I searched for a while on that newspaper, but there was never a story of any girl reported missing by anyone during,",
ACT_2_18.2,"as the papers were now calling it,",
ACT_2_18.3,"The [i]Ufana[/i] crisis. The only statistics the papers focused on were the amount missing,",
ACT_2_18.4,"amount dead,",
ACT_2_18.5,"property destroyed,",
ACT_2_18.6,and amount arrested.,
ACT_2_18.7,"At one point I found the 'puzzle section of the week' page, where that day's puzzle was",
ACT_2_18.8,tracing your way out of a maze.,
ACT_2_18.9,"Even though I was super bored, I would never attempt a maze in my life.",
ACT_2_18.10,"They seemed very confusing to me, and always generated a certain irritation in me that made me want to pull my hair out.\n\n",
ACT_2_18.11,Above it was a 'fun animal fact of the week' and it had a picture of a frog expanding its throat.,
ACT_2_18.12,"The fact was,",
ACT_2_18.13,'Do you know? The vocal-sac of a frog can be one-third the size of a frog's body!',
ACT_2_19.1,"'You might wanna use this on your way back home for the tiffin,' I handed the paper back to the soldier.\n\n",
ACT_2_19.2,"'I think most probably we would end up eating from the stations, I don’t think either of us would get the time to return to our house and get a travel lunch packed for the journey,' he replied with a chuckle.",
ACT_2_20.1,"'You can get them packed from [i]‘Restaurant Alpha’[/i]. I heard they started doing tiffin packaging right now.  All you have to do is give them your tiffin and the menu you want, and they will pack it for you,'",
ACT_2_20.2,"That was the suggestion I gave, because I wanted none of them to enter my house and ask my wife if she would be angel enough to cook them a meal.",
ACT_2_20.3,I did not want either of them to look at her.\n\n,
ACT_2_20.4,"Both looked like men who probably lived in gutters somewhere, and I could not let anyone like that near my...",
ACT_2_21.1,...beloved.,
ACT_2_22.1,"When the train finally moved, a man who boarded from the station sat near me.",
ACT_2_22.2,"Both soldiers who were eating very casually by then, suddenly became alert, with their backs fully straight, and their eyes staring right at the man.",
ACT_2_23.1,"'Excuse me,' the man slipped his hand inside his jacket, 'if you have some time, I have some....'",
ACT_2_24.1,"[color=red][shake rate=5 level=10]He is going to kill you. He got a gun. He is going to kill you. He got a gun. He will shoot you. Yes, yes, he will shoot you. Right at the temple, right through your brains the bullet will fly, the blood will flow...it will flow and flow and flow, all over the fucking place. You will scream and gasp for air. Oh sorry, you won't. Until, until, he is not planning to make it a quick death, but a painful one. Then he will shoot right at the chest. One bullet. Two bullets. Three. Your lungs will puncture, the rib cage will break at so many places by the force of the bullet, that the bones will shatter like glass. The shattered bones will stab you everywhere in your meat. Every pulse will puncture, and blood will flow out. You will try to gasp for air, but the air will escape you outwards instead of going inwards. You will scream, scream, scream, or you will try to, but to no avail. The air will all go out, everything inside will swell and puncture, everything will die, the brain will heat up in panic and struggle, the heart will puncture, and then everything will start to die. Everything inside you will start to die! It will shut down and you will die...die.....DIE. Everything will be...[/shake][/color]",
ACT_2_25.1,"'...over with you,'",
ACT_2_25.2,The man smiled and took out a notepad from his jacket pocket.,
ACT_2_26.1,"'Huh,'",
ACT_2_26.2,was all I could muster.,
ACT_2_26.3,"Though the way I let that word out, it thankfully made me look more like a person with lack of sleep than a person scared for his life.\n\n",
ACT_2_26.4,"'Sir,'",
ACT_2_26.5,"said the guy who had brought me pouched milk,",
ACT_2_26.6,'he is asking you for an interview.',
ACT_2_27.1,"'Oh,' I relaxed, 'no, sorry, not interested.'",
ACT_2_28.1,"'Okay,' the man slipped the notepad under his jacket,",
ACT_2_28.2,"'But on a casual talk, you are wearing a pin of TYPE 9 on your left shoulder, which tells me that you are head of clerical department, but you also have a golden grain pin of TYPE 7 on your right side, which tells me that you are also Head of The Communications Department.",
ACT_2_28.3,How come?,
ACT_2_28.4,"Just for my curiosity's sake, I would like to know.",
ACT_2_28.5,You have my word this is all off the record.',
ACT_2_29.1,"Before either of the men could have told him to shut it, I replied, 'My outpost was short staffed. The head of communication had his....issues with the leadership. He is on a suspension period as we talk. The new Head of communications will be installed next Sunday.'\n\n",
ACT_2_29.2,"'Interesting,'",
ACT_2_29.3,"The man clapped his hand,",
ACT_2_29.4,'so you were initially only the Head of the Clerical Department. What issues did the previous head of...',
ACT_2_30.1,"'I think sir has made it clear that he is not interested in any sort of talk with you, he is off-duty,'",
ACT_2_30.2,"Those words from the man who brought me a milk pouch, stopped him in his tracks.",
ACT_2_30.3,"He smiled as he got off the seat and followed it with giving me a salute, saying,",
ACT_2_30.4,"'I wish you all the best on your holiday, and I hope no one's bad wishes or grudges get to you,'",
ACT_2_30.5,"and started moving to his actual seat, which was probably three coaches away from mine.",
ACT_2_31.1,I will say this...,
ACT_2_31.2,his salute was amazing.,
ACT_2_31.3,"His feet stomped the right way,",
ACT_2_31.4,and his arms had an energy to them that spoke of a man of herculean strength.,
ACT_2_31.5,"He was fit,",
ACT_2_31.6,"healthy,",
ACT_2_31.7,"muscular,",
ACT_2_31.8,and had a great body that would've been perfect as a soldier on the field.,
ACT_2_31.9,"That is why, seeing him wear civilian clothes and carrying a notepad,",
ACT_2_31.10,was an unfortunate shame.,
ACT_2_32.1,"'Thank you gentlemen,'",
ACT_2_32.2,I nodded to the two soldiers as they left in the same taxi that they delivered me and my luggage to.,
ACT_2_32.3,"Seeing them out of sight made me happy, for there was only one face I needed to see for the next month.",
ACT_2_33.1,"I slipped in the spare key I always carried, and unlocked the door.",
ACT_2_34.1,I was back in my lovely house.,
ACT_2_34.2,"I remember when this house was gifted to us by Kaede's father as part of the dowry. At first sight I had seen something very lavish and beautiful, and while there were some cobwebs starting to appear here and there now, its western look still shined above any local [i]Yhafa[/i] structure.",
ACT_2_34.3,"Who would want to live with woods, muds, and tatamis all their lives, when marbles, carpets, and cement can be all around them.",
ACT_2_34.4,"If only the [i]Conferri[/i] madness wasn't taking so much of the funding, then I believe everyone in [i]Yhafa[/i] would be capable of living this lavish life.\n\n",
ACT_2_34.5,'Kaede!',
ACT_2_34.6,I shouted her name.,
ACT_2_34.7,"I could not bear to waste another second without her,",
ACT_2_34.8,'Kaede!',
ACT_2_34.9,"I shouted again, and her gentle steps walked out of the kitchen, and into the living room.",
ACT_2_35.1,'O-o-oh yo-y-you a-a-are...',
ACT_2_36.1,"'Oh you are back,' Kaede's smiling face was as beautiful as ever,",
ACT_2_36.2,"'Welcome back, my love.'",
ACT_2_36.3,I ran to her and grabbed her by her shoulder and started kissing her all over...,
ACT_2_37.1,...her beautiful smiling face.,
ACT_2_38.1,'Please st...',
ACT_2_39.1,"'Oh-ho, stop you,' she spoke as lovingly as ever.",
ACT_2_39.2,"She had all the woman-like qualities that one could aspire to have, and that smile of hers was one of the best things about her.",
ACT_2_39.3,A man could only wish to have a perfect woman like her.,
ACT_2_40.1,"'I missed you so much,' I got down on my knees and started kissing her belly,",
ACT_2_40.2,'I missed you both so much.,
ACT_2_40.3,My dear son.'\n\n,
ACT_2_40.4,"Her hands ran through my hair, and she spoke with....",
ACT_2_41.1,"...that ever-loving voice of hers, 'You should get a bath.'\n\n",
ACT_2_41.2,"I rested my head on her chest and said, 'Will you...'",
ACT_2_42.1,'...join me. It has been so long without you.',
ACT_2_42.2,I said caressing her.,
ACT_2_42.3,"Goosebumps rose in her skin, I knew that she wanted me and was unable to hold her excitement as well.",
ACT_2_43.1,"However, probably showing restraint for the sake of our child, she said, 'I have some kitchen work to do,' and gently, with shaking arms she broke off from my grip, and started walking towards the kitchen.",
ACT_2_43.2,"Her legs shook the entire time,",
ACT_2_43.3,probably from the excitement of finally meeting me.,
ACT_2_43.4,"It had been so long since we were apart, I could imagine her fears then, thinking that any day tragic news may arrive saying that I had fallen to the enemy, and so it was no wonder she could not hide her happiness upon seeing me.",
ACT_2_43.5,"I did not protest her breaking me off like that though, for I knew she was showing restraint for the boy she carried in her.",
ACT_2_43.6,That maturity was one of the reasons I loved her so much.,
ACT_2_44.1,"When I got back after bathing, I found Kaede still working in the kitchen.",
ACT_2_44.2,She was cutting vegetables for me.,
ACT_2_44.3,"That night on the menu, it seemed to be bottle gourd.",
ACT_2_44.4,"Even if she were serving me poison, I was sure that I would gulp it down in one go.",
ACT_2_44.5,"Still, the trip had made me weary, and the bottle gourd was the last thing I wanted to see.\n\n",
ACT_2_44.6,'My love!',
ACT_2_44.7,"I shouted,",
ACT_2_44.8,"'Can it not be bottle gourd today, had that thing a lot during the last few days of shift. I would like to taste lady fingers instead if possible.'",
ACT_2_45.1,"Without staring towards me, she gently nodded her head, and threw the pot with the bottle gourd onto the sink, and from the cupboard she took out another pot, and then staring at me she asked...",
ACT_2_45.2,'W-w-would you pre-prefer normal fried...',
ACT_2_46.1,"'My love, would you like normal fried or with fillings, or would you like my lady fingers, he-he,'",
ACT_2_46.2,Her jokes were as loving as ever.\n\n,
ACT_2_46.3,"I chuckled and giving her a wink, I said, 'I would like the ones with filling for dinner, and your fingers for the dessert.'\n\n",
ACT_2_46.4,"She smiled,",
ACT_2_46.5,"dear god,",
ACT_2_46.6,how she smiled at that.,
ACT_2_46.7,How her eyes twinkled.,
ACT_2_46.8,"I could have picked her up then and there, and started kissing her again all over the place, if not for...",
ACT_2_47.1,...that bell ringing.\n\n,
ACT_2_47.2,"Not wanting her to trouble herself to walk all the way to the door, I told her,",
ACT_2_47.3,"'I will see who it is,'",
ACT_2_47.4,and she replied back with a gentle nod.\n\n,
ACT_2_47.5,Walking to the door I had to suddenly stop.,
ACT_2_48.1,"For, out of nowhere, a very annoying ringing noise reverberated in my left ear.",
ACT_2_48.2,"Thinking that it was just leftover water in my ears from the bath I just took, I leaned my head sideways left and, with my index finger, started rubbing it to bring all the water out.\n\n",
ACT_2_48.3,"It seemed that it did the work, because soon enough, the ringing noise stopped.",
ACT_2_49.1,"And as soon as the ringing noise stopped, I realized that the doorbell didn't ring a second time.",
ACT_2_49.2,"By now, even if the soldiers who escorted me here were the ones ringing the bell, they would’ve attempted a second ring, even if it meant that I was going to scold them.",
ACT_2_49.3,"And yet,",
ACT_2_49.4,no second doorbell ever rang...,
ACT_2_49.5,"instead,",
ACT_2_49.6,what I found on the ground...,
ACT_2_50.1,...was a photograph.,
ACT_2_51.1,It was a Polaroid and in it stood seven young figures.,
ACT_2_51.2,"They were wearing school uniforms, and all but one was standing.\n\n",
ACT_2_51.3,"On the leftmost side of the photo was a tall and fat looking kid. From what I could see of his head, his head was shaved like a monk. His stance was casual, not becoming of a youth of his age, and by the looks of it, he had severe difficulties just standing straight. He stood with a slight smile to his face.",
ACT_2_52.1,"On the left of that kid, was a slimmer boy. Everything seemed fine about this young man except his hair.",
ACT_2_52.2,"At first glance, I almost thought that he was a girl or something, and it was only when I noticed his uniform that I came to the conclusion that this was a boy.",
ACT_2_52.3,"However, the way he stood was much more manly than the fool on his right, and yet, just like that fool, he stood with that awful smile on his face.",
ACT_2_53.1,On the extreme right to the group was a girl with a medium sized body.,
ACT_2_53.2,"She was neither too fat, nor too slender.",
ACT_2_53.3,"She was of balanced build, and resembled closely in figure to the slim boy with long hair.",
ACT_2_53.4,"I stared a little back-and-forth at that young girl and the long haired kid, and it was when I noticed and compared both their smiles that I came to the realization, that perhaps",
ACT_2_53.5,they might be siblings.,
ACT_2_54.1,"On the left of that girl were two figures,",
ACT_2_54.2,they too were smiling.,
ACT_2_54.3,"First was a boy, who had perfect length hair and a perfect stance like the boy with long hair, and yet, there was one problem with him.",
ACT_2_54.4,It was his health.,
ACT_2_54.5,"The man was short, and just by looking at him, I could tell that one gust of wind would blow him away.",
ACT_2_54.6,Probably the uniform accounted for fifty percent of his weight.\n\n,
ACT_2_54.7,The second to that boy was another girl.,
ACT_2_54.8,She was tall and had a pony tail.,
ACT_2_54.9,"If it weren't for that crude looking ponytail, and the fact she stood so casually, so un-woman like, then I would say that she could have made for a perfect bride.",
ACT_2_54.10,"Not as good as my Kaede, but I believe that if only she got her attitude straight, and bring more energy to that smile of hers, then she would have lines of suitors waiting to kill themselves over her.",
ACT_2_55.1,"It was in the middle though, where the most pathetic figures could be found smiling.",
ACT_2_55.2,First was the boy who could not even dare to stand still and instead sat on the ground like a maiden.,
ACT_2_55.3,The girl behind him or any of the other girls beside hers should have been the one on the ground sitting like that.,
ACT_2_55.4,This posture would have looked amazing on someone like Kaede.,
ACT_2_55.5,"It was not only his posture though, but his entire body that made it impossible for me, out of shame, to look at him.",
ACT_2_55.6,I could only wonder how his parents dared to look at him every second without slapping him hard to remind him that he was supposed to be a man.\n\n,
ACT_2_55.7,"And in the middle of all of them, was the girl with braided hair.",
ACT_2_55.8,"From her face, she looked the same age as the other girls, and yet, her body was thin, tiny, and weak.",
ACT_2_55.9,"While her hands were hidden behind the kneeling idiot's head, I could tell that she was awkwardly covering her belly.",
ACT_2_56.1,"When I finished analyzing that photo, I opened the door, only to find no one standing there.",
ACT_2_56.2,"I waited for a while, looked around, and when I found no one standing at either side of my house, I shut the door again, and walked back to my sofa and just sat there staring at the Polaroid again.",
ACT_2_56.3,"Dinner was still some time away, and so I might've stared at it for only a while before my eyes started to drop and everything went black.",
ACT_2_57.1,"'No-no-no, please! Her water...'",
ACT_2_57.2,"That voice still roamed in my head, but now, it sounded sharper and clearer.",
ACT_2_57.3,"On the phone I could hear the distant noises, but now, that voice as it rotated in my head, seemed clearer,",
ACT_2_57.4,and closer.,
ACT_2_57.5,It almost felt like he was,
ACT_2_57.6,standing next to me.,
ACT_2_58.1,"I felt him leaning at me,",
ACT_2_58.2,breathing down on me.,
ACT_2_58.3,[i]Huff. Huff[/i]. His breath went.,
ACT_2_58.4,I could make out the tiniest details of his respiratory motions.,
ACT_2_58.5,"Every time his lungs would attempt to expand, trying to grow back to a normal length, and yet,",
ACT_2_58.6,they never would.,
ACT_2_58.7,"The respiration would be cut short halfway through, and hasty breaths would be taken, turning normal breathing into...",
ACT_2_59.1,...heavy grunts.,
ACT_2_60.1,"Somehow, I was starting to feel his breathing on my face as well, even though a little part of my consciousness knew he wasn't there.",

ACT_2_64.1,That terrible noise returned again.\n\n,
ACT_2_64.2,'Who?',
ACT_2_64.3,"my unconscious mind spoke, my voice echoed.",

ACT_2_65.1,'Ahhhh!',
ACT_2_65.2,I woke up with a scream and…,
ACT_2_66.1,...that noise was still ringing in my right ear.,
ACT_2_66.2,"I once again tilted my head and rubbed my ear, and before I knew it, that noise was gone.\n\n",
ACT_2_66.3,"I took a sigh of relief and told myself,",

ACT_2_66.7,"There was something about it that I hated, but I could not put my finger to it.",
ACT_2_66.8,"I didn't even know how it got to my doorstep and who sent it, but it was definitely a weird thing that I was still trying to comprehend.\n\n",
ACT_2_66.9,"In that comprehension, every time I stared at that Polaroid,",
ACT_2_66.10,I wanted to tear it apart.,
ACT_2_66.11,"I don't know why, but in me, it erupted an unusual anger.",
ACT_2_66.12,It was just a harmless photograph.,
ACT_2_66.13,What could it do to me?,

ACT_2_69.2,"she moved and awkwardly pulling out the chair from the dining table, she sat down.",
ACT_2_69.3,"She did not have a plate prepared for herself, maybe she already ate.",
ACT_2_69.4,"I should've arrived here by afternoon, but unfortunately it took me until night to get here, so I could understand if she thought that I would arrive by tomorrow, and ate dinner before me.\n\n",

ACT_2_70.4,After dinner I was adamant to hear my boy’s kicks.\n\n,
ACT_2_70.5,"'Kaede,'",
ACT_2_70.6,I pressed her hand without a warning.,
ACT_2_71.1,"'Yes, my love.'",
ACT_2_72.1,"'Can you get me some wine from the kitchen as well? I would like to drink it fresh, poured from your hands into this glass,'",
ACT_2_72.2,I picked up the empty shiny glass on the table.,
ACT_2_72.3,She nodded her head and slowly made her way towards the kitchen.,
ACT_2_72.4,God only knows how I loved this woman.,
ACT_2_73.1,I turned on the television and before long Kaede returned with the wine.,
ACT_2_73.2,"As much as I wanted to look at her while eating, my eyes darted towards the television, on which the news ran about the events that transpired.",
ACT_2_73.3,"It had the normal stuff, the news singing praises of our great leader's ability to defuse situations, and regular reports on how [i]Sutwandra[/i] as a country might be planning an attack anytime soon.",
ACT_2_73.4,"The usual scandals of their leader was on the news, on his affairs, previous corruption charges, and showcased his speech where he talked about [i]Conferri[/i]'s being one of the [i]Sutwandras[/i] themselves.",
ACT_2_73.5,This denouncing of [i]Conferri[/i] people as not [i]Yhafanians[/i] but [i]Sutwandras[/i] was followed by clips of [i]Conferri[/i] people living there saying that they do not wish to be part of [i]Sutwandras[/i].,
ACT_2_73.6,"One woman was shown screaming,",
ACT_2_73.7,"'We are not [i]Sutwandras[/i], we are not [i]Yh[/i]…' but before she could say her next words, the clip abruptly cut to the newscaster saying,",
ACT_2_73.8,"'As you can see, the [i]Sutwandras[/i] total lack of respect regarding fellow [i]Yhafanians[/i] living there is nothing short of a disrespect to the people who spread our cul...'",
ACT_2_74.1,I changed the channel.,
ACT_2_75.1,Another news channel spoke of Isamu and his life.,
ACT_2_75.2,"Seiko cried and told the media how brave and honorable he was, saving her honor.",
ACT_2_75.3,"At one point, her glasses fell to the ground, and she crouched to pick them. Suddenly, as she was leaning in, a bottle of eye drops fell out of her pocket, and she quickly picked it up and slipped it back, before it could be noticed.",
ACT_2_75.4,"Thankfully, I told her to wear glasses to the interview, just so in case something like this happened, she would have a cover up and say that the bottle of eye drops was for her bad eyesight, and the glasses would serve as an alibi.\n\n",
ACT_2_75.5,"From the same pocket where she slipped in the eye drops, she took out a handkerchief and sneezed on it.",
ACT_2_75.6,"Then looking at the mic and staring right at the television camera, and in effect, towards me, she spoke,",
ACT_2_75.7,"'He was a true soldier, for he didn't even let a single crack come to my glasses. Not even a single touch. I hope the bastards who killed him face the most painful death of their life.'",
ACT_2_76.1,I changed the channel and there were some [i]Conferri[/i],
ACT_2_76.2,...uh....,
ACT_2_76.3,how shall I put it....,
ACT_2_76.4,those kind of workers on the screen.,
ACT_2_76.5,"They stood near, what seemed to be, an abandoned building.",
ACT_2_76.6,One of them had red eyes and needle marks all over her arms.,
ACT_2_76.7,"She looked at the mic and tapping it,",
ACT_2_76.8,"she laughed,",
ACT_2_76.9,'He. He. Is this working?'\n\n,
ACT_2_76.10,"The reporter asked in a proper, professional tone with her, 'So, how is it that your life ended up like this?'",
ACT_2_77.1,"Suddenly, a noise of something falling to the ground echoed through the place.",
ACT_2_77.2,"My ears listened with great concentration, as someone in the distance spoke,",
ACT_2_77.3,"'Hey, don't drop the fucking cue card?'",
ACT_2_77.4,and then I heard the noise of that something being picked up.,
ACT_2_77.5,"The reporter cleared her throat and asked, 'Sorry, it seems that one of our reporters accidentally dropped a boom mic. Anyway, how would you say your life ended up like this?'\n\n",
ACT_2_77.6,"'My, my, the stars have fallen down on earth, look, look, this one looks like my dead brother,'",
ACT_2_77.7,"The girl was out of it, she was staring at the ceilings, counting stars and what not.",
ACT_2_77.8,The reporter gently...,
ACT_2_77.9,"no,",
ACT_2_77.10,"it was kind of hard actually, with the jerk she pulled her arm with.",
ACT_2_78.1,"I briefly, for a split second, got to see the reporter's face, it was full of frowns.",
ACT_2_78.2,"Then the hand that didn't hold the mic, pointed at something behind the camera.",
ACT_2_78.3,"After it, her face turned full of this artificial smile, as she spoke,",
ACT_2_78.4,"'Please look at the camera and tell us, who would you blame for the state that you and other girls like you find themselves in.",
ACT_2_78.5,You said earlier that you had an interest in music...',

ACT_2_79.29,"Her red eyes opened, and the reporter pointed straight at something behind the camera and said,",

However, in the end, it is their sacrifice that has kept the pillars of our nation still standing.

ACT_2_82.1,"This had never happened before, but for some reason that day, I was not interested in what the great leader had to say.",
ACT_2_82.2,"Telling myself that I would see the reruns the next day, I changed the channel, and immediately heard the voice I recognized.",
ACT_2_82.3,"There was a man on it, standing a few feet in front from a barricade.",
ACT_2_82.4,"He was tearfully speaking,",
ACT_2_82.5,"'He was a great friend, and an equally brave soldier.'\n\n",
ACT_2_82.6,"Behind the barricade stood many people, and one of them held a cardboard sheet, on which was a photo that I could not make out because the camera's focus was on the man, and hence the background completely looked blurry.",
ACT_2_82.7,"However,",
ACT_2_82.8,"I could make out the large black words painted on the cardboard, and they said,",

ACT_2_85.2,or at least I wish I could say that.,
ACT_2_85.3,For his tone may have sounded cheerful and friendly but...,
ACT_2_86.1,...all I could observe again was that serious face of his.,

ACT_2_89.1,"The telephone suddenly started ringing, and breaking her hand off from mine, she rushed towards the phone saying, 'I'll get it,' in a squeaky squirrel-like voice.",

ACT_2_90.1,'I-it-its...',

ACT_2_91.2,I laid a kiss on the same hand that handed me the receiver.,
ACT_2_91.3,"She jerked it away again, and if it was any other woman, I would've thought if I overdid it a little, but looking at her...",
ACT_2_92.1,...I could tell that I could never overdo it with my Kaede.,
ACT_2_93.1,"'Hey,' I said without any formality.",
ACT_2_93.2,"Currently as it stood, I was just a civilian, so I was talking to a friend, and not to my senior in command.\n\n",
ACT_2_93.3,"'Hello, Ronan,' Rikki's voice was professional, but he didn't stress any authority over me, just gritting his teeth, probably chewing tobacco, he questioned,",
ACT_2_93.4,'Everything's alright at home?'\n\n,
ACT_2_93.5,"'Yes, it's lovely. Kaede and the baby are fine, '",
ACT_2_93.6,"I gave another glance at Kaede's lovely face, her face was staring away, not at the television but at something else.",
ACT_2_93.7,"Perhaps she was thinking something, and whatever she was thinking she was very much lost in it.",
ACT_2_93.8,"Perhaps, she was still not believing that I was alive,",
ACT_2_93.9,perhaps there were doubts.,
ACT_2_93.10,"Perhaps she was wondering whether it was a dream or not,",
ACT_2_93.11,"and I can't blame her,",
ACT_2_93.12,for there were moments that I too could not assure that I was here.\n\n,
ACT_2_93.13,"Here,",
ACT_2_93.14,next to her.,
ACT_2_94.1,"'Well, I do not wish to trouble you much but...'",
ACT_2_95.1,"Whatever Rikki said next, was lost to my ears.",
ACT_2_95.2,"Suddenly, that same ringing tune reverberated again. I distanced myself from the receiver, and the noise still persisted. I leaned my head and rubbed it with my index finger again.",
ACT_2_95.3,"The noise wouldn't go, so I rubbed harder and harder and harder until... that noise didn’t echo anymore, and I could hear Rikki's voice screaming from the receiver,",
ACT_2_95.4,"'Ronan, you there?!'",
ACT_2_96.1,"'Ye-yes, I am here,' I was afraid he was angry at me again, but his voice calmed down.\n\n",
ACT_2_96.2,"'What happened? I was trying to get a response out of you for a while, and you were dead silent,'",
ACT_2_96.3,"his concern was genuine, and at this point, he sounded as if he feared for my life.\n\n",
ACT_2_96.4,"'Sorry, the telephone acted out a little bit, so your voice was cutting off for some reason, but I can hear you properly now,'",
ACT_2_96.5,I said in one breath fearing another outburst.,
ACT_2_97.1,"'Well, to repeat what I just said, have you heard from the general?'",
ACT_2_97.2,"Rikki's voice was tired, I heard him chewing a little more tobacco,",
ACT_2_97.3,"'He hasn't reported to his mansion yet, and his wife is raising hell here.'\n\n",
ACT_2_97.4,'Not really.'\n\n,
ACT_2_97.5,"Knowing the general, he probably was making love with one of the numerous female members that roamed in his office.",
ACT_2_97.6,"Knowing him, he probably had a meeting with one of the tennis stars he was fond of seeing matches off, and invited her to the...",
ACT_2_97.7,private changing room.,
ACT_2_97.8,"Knowing him, he probably got too drunk, and was possibly beating the life out of whoever dared to warm his bed and then reminding them who he was, and how easily he could end everything for them.\n\n",
ACT_2_97.9,I knew all of that....,
ACT_2_97.10,because Seiko too was once his personal assistant.,
ACT_2_98.1,"'You mean, nothing at all?'",
ACT_2_98.2,"He was tapping the table again,",
ACT_2_98.3,"'Well, I will make a few calls then, but if anything comes up, feel free to tell me.'\n\n",
ACT_2_98.4,"'I will,'",
ACT_2_98.5,"without knowing, I straightened up my back.",
ACT_2_98.6,"My clothes were that of a civilian, and yet, Rikki's voice was making me disciplined as a soldier again.\n\n",
ACT_2_98.7,"'Anyway about the girl and her child,'",
ACT_2_98.8,"Rikki's voice was concerned for some reason,",
ACT_2_98.9,"'you know what to tell when someone asks you, don't you?'\n\n",
ACT_2_98.10,"'Y-yes,'",
ACT_2_98.11,"My reply was simple,",
ACT_2_98.12,'You can rest assured.'\n\n,
ACT_2_98.13,"'Knowing you, I know you must be feeling sad about her baby,'",
ACT_2_98.14,"Rikki's voice suddenly turned reassuring, and that was messing with my head, for all in my head I could see, was that silent cold stare of his,",
ACT_2_98.15,"'But as the...huh, now missing general said, the baby would've turned out just like her parents right, so there was no saving it. It was her blood, and you cannot change what's in one's blood. Yo-You",
ACT_2_98.16,...you....,
ACT_2_98.17,just cannot.',
ACT_2_99.1,"To me, the general had given the explanation of weed and what not, but it seems to Rikki it was something related to blood.",
ACT_2_99.2,"Wait a minute,",
ACT_2_99.3,wasn't he one of the ones present there?,
ACT_2_99.4,"I am not perfectly sure, but I think I heard him laughing.",
ACT_2_99.5,Why would he need the general's reassurance?,
ACT_2_100.1,"'Well, take care then,' He cut off the line abruptly, without saying any proper farewells.",
ACT_2_101.1,"Feeling it strange, I kept down the receiver and turned around, only to see Kaede rubbing her ears with her index finger.",
ACT_2_102.1,"'Did water get in your ears too?' I asked and suddenly, Kaede's head started bobbing as her hand rose to her mouth, and before I knew it...",
ACT_2_103.1,She had vomited all over the place.,
ACT_2_104.1,"The next few minutes were a total panic for me. Kaede was constantly vomiting and I just stood there, staring at her shocked.",
ACT_2_104.2,"I feared she was dying and yet I stood still, unable to do anything.",
ACT_2_104.3,I was confused...,
ACT_2_105.1,...because she looked...,
ACT_2_106.1,"...healthy as ever, and yet, the sounds she made were terrifying.",
ACT_2_106.2,"Just the way she was vomiting all over the place, I could not bear to look at it, and yet, I could not find the strength to move myself.",
ACT_2_107.1,"It was only when she was struggling on the ground and started to crawl towards the telephone, that I found the strength to move and immediately I rushed and dialed the number of the midwife.",
ACT_2_108.1,"The midwife arrived twenty minutes later, and after letting Kaede vomit everything she could, she helped her to the bed.",
ACT_2_108.2,"I was out of the room, as I heard Kaede's panting breaths, at points screaming,",
ACT_2_108.3,"'it hurts, it hurts, I cannot breathe,'",
ACT_2_108.4,and that went on for a good ten minutes.,
ACT_2_108.5,"She eventually calmed down, and the midwife apparently gave her some pills or something, because soon, she was deep in sleep. The midwife then exited and told me that everything was going to be alright.",
ACT_2_108.6,"She might just have exhausted herself with loads of work, and her body was reacting at such a late stage.",
ACT_2_108.7,"She was still in the beginning days of her 8th month, it was likely that a birth was possible anytime soon, but currently, her water hadn't broken yet.\n\n",
ACT_2_108.8,"After telling me to not let her work too much and to expect a birth in any of the upcoming days, she began to leave the house.",
ACT_2_108.9,"She was just near the table when she stopped on her tracks in the living room, and asked,",
ACT_2_108.10,'Is this photo of your father or something?',
ACT_2_109.1,"'Huh,'",
ACT_2_109.2,"confused, I entered the living room.",
ACT_2_110.1,'There is a photo of some students and a man in an army uniform here on the table.,

ACT_2_110.4,"I was still confused,",
ACT_2_110.5,what man?,

ACT_2_114.10,a pain that I found hard to suppress.,
ACT_2_115.1,"As my brain kept screaming for me to move, my body disobeyed it further, hurting itself even more in the process. I could not help it, I was wishing with all my might to not look at this Polaroid....",
