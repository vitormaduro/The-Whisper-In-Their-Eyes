ACT_6_TITLE,ACT SIX: Dreams Of A Broken Spring,
ACT_6_1.1,"'You know what,",
ACT_6_1.2,"I am surprised that you managed to hold onto that mask of yours without ever breaking out into tears on what you became, unwillingly still...",
ACT_6_1.3,"I-I can't imagine acting like that 24 hours by 7, and not breaking apart at some point,'",
ACT_6_1.4,"she was putting back her clothes, and there was a lit cigarette in her mouth.",
ACT_6_1.5,"I was sitting by the bed, my back was a little bent, but my legs were straight enough.",
ACT_6_1.6,"'You know, before Gigi jumped from that window, she once told me about you,'",
ACT_6_1.7,"without even removing the cigarette, she let the smoke escape from her mouth by the sideways of her lip like an amateur puppeteer,",
ACT_6_1.8,"'she told me that one year ago, the last time you took her comfort, you cannot even finish.",
ACT_6_1.9,"You stopped midway and started crying, and then told her to stab you with the ice-pick that was there on the champagne table.",
ACT_6_1.10,She said that...',
ACT_6_2.1,"Before she could continue, I interrupted her by completing her words,",
ACT_6_2.2,'...that I brought that ice-pick so close to my throat that she was convinced that she was going to witness me killing myself...',
ACT_6_3.1,"'...then and there,'",
ACT_6_3.2,"I tried to make it sound like I was chuckling,",
ACT_6_3.3,but all that escaped from my mouth was a simple 'tsk'.,
ACT_6_3.4,"She was properly dressed by now, and came out of the bathroom and sat by the bedside.",
ACT_6_3.5,"We still had forty minutes left, I always booked them for 90 minutes, never had to even bargain for price because I wasn't the one paying, and the man who ran this entire operation feared me, even though I never said a single word to him.",
ACT_6_3.6,I booked them for 90 minutes because I needed sleep.,
ACT_6_3.7,"The 'comfort' was just a formality,",
ACT_6_3.8,there were many times that I didn't even perform them.,
ACT_6_4.1,"'You know,",
ACT_6_4.2,"I have been with one of your men, and just by listening to them one could tell that they had created a myth about how long you can last,'",
ACT_6_4.3,"it was then that she finally removed that cigarette and created a small smoke ring in the air,",
ACT_6_4.4,'I am surprised none of the other girls have spilled the truth about you.',
ACT_6_4.5,"'Even if they did,'",
ACT_6_4.6,"I collapsed my back onto the bed and she too raised her legs and crossed them,",
ACT_6_4.7,"'I am pretty sure they will never say it to my face. I wish one of them did, for then I can break down and just accept that there is one person I know, for whom, at least one factor of my mask that I can let crack. By the way, why are you sad for me, I'm pretty sure you do it more than I do.'",
ACT_6_5.1,"'Yes,'",
ACT_6_5.2,"she was really getting good at making smoke rings,",
ACT_6_5.3,"'but I am paid to care. Even though the payment comes in the form of me keeping my head intact, and not being a lab rat like Gigi was for whatever drugs they transferred here, but I-I...eh",
ACT_6_5.4,....ah.....,
ACT_6_5.5,you know that one banned [i]Hindarav[/i] movie whose bootleg vhs piracy here became a national topic.,
ACT_6_5.6,You remember that scene where the girl...,
ACT_6_5.7,"that [i]Conferri[/i] character,",
ACT_6_5.8,"who was just a slave to that real life [i]Hindarav[/i] general,",
ACT_6_5.9,"y-yes, I think it was her...",
ACT_6_5.10,"remember when she said to her [i]Yhafian[/i] lover,",
ACT_6_5.11,"the one who wished to exact revenge on her behalf against the officer who killed her brother,",
ACT_6_5.12,"but the general at that point was keeping an eye on her to know locations of the rebels,",
ACT_6_5.13,so all she could say during their secret meeting by the pond was...,
ACT_6_5.14,"[i]I am living in a cage, yes, but they haven’t plucked my feathers or cut my legs.[/i]",
ACT_6_5.15,You remember that part?',
ACT_6_6.1,"'I remember,",
ACT_6_6.2,though I cannot remember the reason the film got banned.,
ACT_6_6.3,"I mean, [i]Yhafa[/i] hates Hindaravs just like anyone else who were once in their empire. That film was made by [i]Hindarav[/i] people yes, but it was made by people who were ashamed of the history and legacy of darkness that country had left on half the world, killing and enslaving people in the name of civility.",
ACT_6_6.4,I am pretty sure [i]Yhafa[/i] would've loved it.,
ACT_6_6.5,"Though, as said, I can't figure out what was the reason it got banned, was it because it showed love between a fictional [i]Yhafa[/i] freedom fighter and a fictional [i]Conferri[/i] girl, or....'",
ACT_6_6.6,"At this point she had started to run her hand through my hair, I wish I could say they were soft, but they weren't. A lot of needle marks and cut scratches had made the palm uneven.",
ACT_6_6.7,'...o-or was it because it acknowledged the very fucking existence of the [i]Conferris[/i] themselves.',
ACT_6_7.1,"'Maybe it was both,'",
ACT_6_7.2,"there was no ashtray in this place that always seemed to fall apart, and so, she threw the remaining cigarette just at the corner of the room.",
ACT_6_7.3,"If this was a place with carpets or any sense of polish, it would be a bad move, for it would lead to a fire hazard, but this place to the outside world was an abandoned building, and the walls and theirs plasters were falling apart, the doors were seriously prone to giving one splinters, and there was not even a single window.",
ACT_6_7.4,The scenes of indecencies from the outside world were hidden by long curtains that could've fallen anytime.,
ACT_6_7.5,"Still, it would not be a problem in a sense.",
ACT_6_7.6,Everyone knew what went around in that decrepit building:,
ACT_6_7.7,"comfort woman business on top floors,",
ACT_6_7.8,"drug labs underground,",
ACT_6_7.9,and homeless people for showcase in the middle.,
ACT_6_7.10,"It was all just a game of averting eyes, and pretending that what you saw from the naked eye was just a dream.",
ACT_6_7.11,"After all, why would this building owned by one of the bigger politicians in this country would ever be running anything bad?",
ACT_6_8.1,"'By the way,'",
ACT_6_8.2,"I managed to whisper,",
ACT_6_8.3,"'I do cry. Though alone, in any place that I can find and assure to the fullest would be abandoned.",
ACT_6_8.4,The night where I tried to kill myself in front of Gigi was just one of them.,
ACT_6_8.5,"That night I was also drunk, so it all flew out at once.",
ACT_6_8.6,Bad mistake.,
ACT_6_8.7,"Even when I am talking to those people,",
ACT_6_8.8,"pretending to be Captain Rikki Takahashi,",
ACT_6_8.9,pretending that I was tough and disciplined to my superiors;,
ACT_6_8.10,foul mouthed and perverted to the people of my standing or people I come to this place with;,
ACT_6_8.11,or the people I call friends;,
ACT_6_8.12,and then pretending to be that particular version of a tough man to those who are thrown at my lap to be looked after....,
ACT_6_8.13,it all becomes too much.,
ACT_6_8.14,"There are days when I forget that I am the same Rikki who does not like anything he does for a living. Killing people, ordering to kill people, cover-ups, protecting the delusional scum who are so lost in shaping the world to their ideals that they forget that they are not fucking molding it,",
ACT_6_8.15,they are fucking breaking it....,
ACT_6_8.16,then having to laugh like fucking maniac when one just right in front of me takes a life pretending that the man who was on the ground begging to not be killed deserved to get killed because...,
ACT_6_8.17,because he dared to have a fucking identity.,
ACT_6_8.18,"Then letting your real self slip with a 'uhh' or some other sort of slip up, then having your heart race and wish that nobody around you saw through that, for you know what the consequences would be once they know what you truly are.",
ACT_6_8.19,And what you truly are is not like the man on that fucking poster.,
ACT_6_8.20,"In fact, I don't know a single man in the force or outside who is like that poster guy.",
ACT_6_8.21,"Some pretend like they are, but they don't know that what they are doing is becoming the very same monster that the poster guy is supposed to fight against.",
ACT_6_8.22,Hehe.,
ACT_6_8.23,"It is kind of funny to see them blow up their chest and put a gun to a defenseless man, and then scream",
ACT_6_8.24,that they did it for the fucking country.',
ACT_6_9.1,'It is comedic to be honest.,
ACT_6_9.2,"I wish I still had humor left in me, so I could laugh.",
ACT_6_9.3,But after you have taken so many lives –,
ACT_6_9.4,"directly,",
ACT_6_9.5,"indirectly,",
ACT_6_9.6,"forced,",
ACT_6_9.7,or whatever in fucking between –,
ACT_6_9.8,you start having a realization that those who took happiness away from someone does not deserve one themselves.,
ACT_6_9.9,"Also the thing is, some of them, as harmless as they may seem initially,",
ACT_6_9.10,can be the scariest fucking people you ever met.,
ACT_6_9.11,"I know,",
ACT_6_9.12,"because there is one guy like that,",
ACT_6_9.13,"who thinks I am his best friend,",
ACT_6_9.14,but little does he know...',
ACT_6_10.1,'...is that I am terrified of him.',
ACT_6_11.1,"'That man I tell you,",
ACT_6_11.2,he is no pushover.,
ACT_6_11.3,"When you look at him from the outside, he seems like a gentle and simple minded fool you know. You think you can have drinks with the guy,'",
ACT_6_11.4,"Before I could say anything further, she suddenly tapped me on the shoulder.",
ACT_6_12.1,"'You mind if I took some shots,'",
ACT_6_12.2,"she was scratching her arms, it was probably the time she was beginning to relapse.",
ACT_6_12.3,"'You don't need my permission,'",
ACT_6_12.4,"It was getting a little hot in that place, and so she got out of the bed and was tightening a black string around her arms and took out an injection from the wooden wardrobe near the wall whose plaster was basically non-existence.",
ACT_6_12.5,"I continued mumbling while scratching the area around my neck,",
ACT_6_12.6,"'So,",
ACT_6_12.7,"you know,",
ACT_6_12.8,this guy.,
ACT_6_12.9,He looks like one of those chickens you can run over.,
ACT_6_12.10,"However, once you see him angry, then only you would know that he is possibly the most terrifying thing that you can ever get close to. The fear he gives me every time I see his angry eyes, is a fear I have felt only twice before in my life.'",
ACT_6_13.1,"'The first time was when I saw my father kill my mother, right in front of our dinner table.",
ACT_6_13.2,"It happened out of nowhere,",
ACT_6_13.3,"at one moment he was accusing her of sleeping with the groundskeeper, and the next moment, he was spitting over her dead body, and telling me that I needed to make sure, that whenever I get a wife,",
ACT_6_13.4,she wouldn't be a who...,
ACT_6_13.5,COFF...,
ACT_6_13.6,"COFF,' two big coughs escaped me.",
ACT_6_13.7,"Dry and vibrating, I felt a real pain surge through my chest.",
ACT_6_14.1,"'The other time was eight years ago, when I was posted to Outpost-11 near the Reiki Prefecture.",
ACT_6_14.2,"At that point,",
ACT_6_14.3,"a little girl,",
ACT_6_14.4,"and when I say little, I mean really fucking little...",
ACT_6_14.5,"she was like five at best and she literally tried to attack me with a knife screaming,",
ACT_6_14.6,'you made mommy scream! You made mommy scream!',
ACT_6_14.7,At that time I didn't know what the actual fuck to do.,
ACT_6_14.8,"It was very easy to disarm her, she was the weight of a paper, and yet, I stood still just like that,",
ACT_6_14.9,fearful of what she was going to do.',
ACT_6_15.1,"'Like,",
ACT_6_15.2,how can I explain...,
ACT_6_15.3,"I have been near death a lot many times, but most of those times, the individual that attempts to kill me is almost the same as me.",
ACT_6_15.4,"Heck,",
ACT_6_15.5,"I haven't even had a ground duty in eight years,",
ACT_6_15.6,"I was handling the entire [i]Ufana[/i] case from a secured van,",
ACT_6_15.7,"keeping communications,",
ACT_6_15.8,"and barking the fucking orders,",
ACT_6_15.9,but still...,
ACT_6_15.10,you get my point right...,
ACT_6_15.11,"I still remember the thousands of times someone pointed a gun at me,",
ACT_6_15.12,and I remember all those thousand times....',
ACT_6_15.13,"By this point she was striking the needle of the injection, making sure the dose wasn't lethal or by the way she was filling it up, making sure that it was.",
ACT_6_15.14,"I continued,",
ACT_6_15.15,'Not a single fear of death.,
ACT_6_15.16,Not a single time that I fucking hated death.,
ACT_6_15.17,"Some of those times, I wished that the bullet would finally hit me, that I won’t have to keep this charade any longer, but what can I say, I was lucky all those times.",
ACT_6_15.18,The mask stayed on.',
ACT_6_16.1,"'So,",
ACT_6_16.2,"this girl right,",
ACT_6_16.3,"she is swinging the knife at me,",
ACT_6_16.4,"and I am standing motionless,",
ACT_6_16.5,not knowing what to do.,
ACT_6_16.6,"I remember my legs were fucking shaking at their place, if I had anything to drink before, I am pretty sure I would've having fucking pissed myself.",
ACT_6_16.7,"She was just about to stab me with that knife you know,'",
ACT_6_16.8,"The needle went into her skin, and soon that drug was pumped into her veins.",
ACT_6_16.9,When my unit visited [i]Sutwandra[/i] as an escort to the scum they called,
ACT_6_16.10,“The Great Leader”,
ACT_6_16.11,"during the peace meeting three years ago,",
ACT_6_16.12,"I had seen similar people there, but they would always boil it before using,",
ACT_6_16.13,but she....,
ACT_6_16.14,she was taking it raw.,
ACT_6_16.15,"I would be surprised to see her alive the next time I visited,",
ACT_6_16.16,'So...',
ACT_6_17.1,"Before I could continue she let out a large sigh, followed by three coughs, as she continued to shake the part of her arm where she had taken the drugs from.",
ACT_6_17.2,"'OooOh...sorryyy...you continue,'",
ACT_6_17.3,"she trembled her way back to the bed, and wrapped her arm around me,",
ACT_6_17.4,"'Don't worry, I stay dizzy for the first five minutes of taking this stuff, but I am fully awake, and soon I will be my normal talking self. God gifted me a gift you know, and that gift seems to be surviving doses that would kill a fucking horse...hehe.",
ACT_6_17.5,I am not like Frima you know...,
ACT_6_17.6,that girl who was singing on the TV.,
ACT_6_17.7,"You can give her nano-gram of a dose and she will stay fucking high for the next year or so. I am no lab rat like Gigi either; I stole these on my own accord. I have some agency here,",
ACT_6_17.8,even if it is the agency of trying to kill myself again and again and failing at it.,
ACT_6_17.9,He-he.',
ACT_6_18.1,"'So,'",
ACT_6_18.2,"I continued,",
ACT_6_18.3,"'before she could stab me, the guard near me kicked her out of the way, and kept kicking the little thing until her nose was broken. You wanna know the scary part in that whole fucking ordeal, it wasn't seeing a grown man angrily kick a little girl until her nose was fucking broken,",
ACT_6_18.4,"it was the eyes,",
ACT_6_18.5,those fucking eyes she stared me with.,
ACT_6_18.6,"She was just five, and yet even when she was crying, her anger never dissipated.",
ACT_6_18.7,"She was staring at me, constantly.",
ACT_6_18.8,"Lik-like the girl wasn't even in the double digits of her age, and yet",
ACT_6_18.9,she carried the vengeance of a lifetime.',
ACT_6_19.1,"'At first we all thought that she was a [i]Conferri[/i],",
ACT_6_19.2,"but it took one day of digging to know that she was nothing but a simple [i]Yhafian[/i] girl from a poor family,",
ACT_6_19.3,"whose mother was missing and father was long dead, i-it,'",
ACT_6_19.4,"I was beginning to choke on my words for some reason, however no tears ever flew out of my eyes,",
ACT_6_19.5,"'It took us another day of investigation to know why the girl was angry and wished to kill me. By that time she was already put into a thought camp, and the exact same thought camp by the way where we sent our head of communication to.'",
ACT_6_19.6,"It was at this moment that I noticed the fan above,",
ACT_6_19.7,it was wiggling at its place a little.,
ACT_6_19.8,"The movements and shaking was very low, I wouldn't even notice it before, but now, my eyes were super concentrated at it.",
ACT_6_19.9,"It felt like that at any moment this fan was gonna fall, and I would be its victim.",
ACT_6_19.10,"Not gonna lie,",
ACT_6_19.11,"I half-wished for it to fall,",
ACT_6_19.12,"and I fucking wished that some rod inside the fan or something would pierce through that bowl shaped circle and just stab me right in the throat,",
ACT_6_19.13,and I wished that that death be painful as fuck.,
ACT_6_19.14,I wanted to suffer.,
ACT_6_20.1,"'Hello, you there,'",
ACT_6_20.2,"she snapped her fingers in-front of me, and I woke out of my trance.",
ACT_6_20.3,"'Your fan,'",
ACT_6_20.4,"I pointed above,",
ACT_6_20.5,'it may fall someday.',
ACT_6_20.6,"'Oh,'",
ACT_6_20.7,"she looked above and laughed,",
ACT_6_20.8,'then I wish that it would fall on me and kill me instantly. What about you? You seem miserable enough. You wish to die from the fan as well?',
ACT_6_20.9,"'I do wish that this fucking fan kills me,'",
ACT_6_20.10,"If I was spilling my past to a drugged up comforter, then I might as well spill my present,",
ACT_6_20.11,'but unlike you I wish for it to kill me painfully.',
ACT_6_20.12,"'Oooo,'",
ACT_6_20.13,"she mocked,",
ACT_6_20.14,'never took an army officer to be so teenage-esque edgy.,
ACT_6_20.15,"You know in [i]Sutwandra[/i],",
ACT_6_20.16,they say some kid wear black eye-liners and black clothes and pretend they are lord of darkness or something.,
ACT_6_20.17,"Same thing in [i]Hindarav[/i] and even, [i]Terro[/i].'",
ACT_6_21.1,"'Captain,'",
ACT_6_21.2,"I corrected,",
ACT_6_21.3,"'I am a Captain,",
ACT_6_21.4,"and yes, I do wish my death will be painful, because that is what I deserve now.",
ACT_6_21.5,I can cry all day to various who...',
ACT_6_21.6,"I almost said the word that I hated the most in this world,",
ACT_6_21.7,'...comfort women.,
ACT_6_21.8,"They can all tell me that it is okay, that there is more life to live.",
ACT_6_21.9,"They can tell me all day that I am a good guy in a bad situation, having to do things that I do not wish to do.",
ACT_6_21.10,"That my soul is pure or something because I inherently did not wish to make anyone suffer or some crap, that I am redeemable and what fucking not.",
ACT_6_21.11,"But the thing is, blood has been spilled by my hands.",
ACT_6_21.12,Suffering has been caused through me.,
ACT_6_21.13,"Whether willingly or unwillingly,",
ACT_6_21.14,I have been a participant in it...,
ACT_6_21.15,not even a FUCKING observer,
ACT_6_21.16,but a participant.,
ACT_6_21.17,"You might not know just from watching the news, but there were more student union leaders than one believes.",
ACT_6_21.18,"Unfortunately, all of them lay beneath some fucking grave in an unnamed and unmarked forest somewhere in [i]Ufana[/i],",
ACT_6_21.19,sixteen or twenty feet deep.,
ACT_6_21.20,"One of them was even pregnant,",
ACT_6_21.21,gave birth as she was shot.,
ACT_6_21.22,"The baby was obviously a fucking still born, I wish life was like the fantasies of a mythology",
ACT_6_21.23,"or a bloody [i]Hindarav[/i] manga,",
ACT_6_21.24,"but no,",
ACT_6_21.25,the baby just flopped itself to the ground.,
ACT_6_21.26,No fucking life in him.,
ACT_6_21.27,"We meant to bury them from the start,",
ACT_6_21.28,"but after that baby incident,",
ACT_6_21.29,"one of the soldiers,",
ACT_6_21.30,"against my orders called a priest, and had the place...",
ACT_6_21.31,HEHE...,
ACT_6_21.32,purified.',
ACT_6_22.1,"'So,",
ACT_6_22.2,"now,",
ACT_6_22.3,"they fucking live sixteen feet under,",
ACT_6_22.4,their identities lost.,
ACT_6_22.5,"In case they have someone they loved,",
ACT_6_22.6,they will never find any answer.,
ACT_6_22.7,Who were they?,
ACT_6_22.8,What were they?,
ACT_6_22.9,What was their favorite song?,
ACT_6_22.10,Favorite flavor of ice-cream?,
ACT_6_22.11,"All will be lost to time, and no one will remember their suffering or even who they were.",
ACT_6_22.12,"Thousands of years will pass by,",
ACT_6_22.13,"contradictions will lead facts to becoming fiction,",
ACT_6_22.14,"a fiction that will be modified for the convenience of some artist and will become a myth,",
ACT_6_22.15,and then that myth will become a legend.,
ACT_6_22.16,"That legend then will be debated upon,",
ACT_6_22.17,"some coming close to what the truth may be,",
ACT_6_22.18,"and others contradicting it till last breath,",
ACT_6_22.19,not wishing to acknowledge that the woods of their rich pillars stand on the ground that is soaked in the blood of innocent fucking people.,
ACT_6_22.20,He-he.,
ACT_6_22.21,"You know,",
ACT_6_22.22,"my father once said that plants of this land do not soak water,",
ACT_6_22.23,they soak blood.,
ACT_6_22.24,My foolish child brain at that time thought that this may be the reason that,
ACT_6_22.25,so many venus fly traps existed in this country.,
ACT_6_22.26,He-He.,
ACT_6_22.27,"You wanna know the worst part,",
ACT_6_22.28,"I can prevent years of confusion and misery,",
ACT_6_22.29,by just giving up the actual facts...,
ACT_6_22.30,like....,
ACT_6_22.31,I...,
ACT_6_22.32,ah....,
ACT_6_22.33,"like I can give those grieving relatives not only the truth, but show them that.",
ACT_6_22.34,So that the world would see from a naked photo and live dead bodies on what was done to souls whose life was cut short so men like me can grow old.,
ACT_6_22.35,"At the risk of my life, I have the power to do so,",
ACT_6_22.36,"but I don't,",
ACT_6_22.37,for I know the consequences of that would be death.,
ACT_6_22.38,"It’s fucking funny,",
ACT_6_22.39,"I claim to not be afraid of death outside of a few instances,",
ACT_6_22.40,but then my body automatically keeps the fucking secrets that preserve this nerve-sucking life.,
ACT_6_22.41,"My body is full of fucking contradictions and exceptions,",
ACT_6_22.42,"my soul is a fucking hypocrite,",
ACT_6_22.43,"and the worst part of it,",
ACT_6_22.44,"my mind knows all the wrongs I do and say,",
ACT_6_22.45,and yet it is unable to comprehend any of them.',
ACT_6_23.1,"'Through every fucking sin, the only way out seems to be death.",
ACT_6_23.2,"Not because I wish to escape this life, but I wish for someone to finally kill and acknowledge the fact that whatever I am protecting and moving forward was wrong, and I need to suffer for it as a result.",
ACT_6_23.3,"I wish someone would tell me that what I thought and suspected was wrong,",
ACT_6_23.4,is fucking wrong!,
ACT_6_23.5,And that for doing it I must be punished.,
ACT_6_23.6,"Because the more time goes by, I keep getting sucked deeper and deeper into this madness,",
ACT_6_23.7,where violence seems to bring everyone peace.,
ACT_6_23.8,This fake peace producing people who are ignorant to that violence –,
ACT_6_23.9,"denying it every fucking day seems to produce new strength in them,",
ACT_6_23.10,"and worst of all, taking the freedom away from other people...",
ACT_6_23.11,other human fucking beings....,
ACT_6_23.12,making them slaves and say that you fucking freed them....,
ACT_6_23.13,IT SEEMS TO BE FUCKING NORMAL.,
ACT_6_23.14,IT IS JUST.,
ACT_6_23.15,SOME EVEN CALL IT FUCKING JUSTICE.,
ACT_6_23.16,"You know, the justice where we are draining out all the soul from a once functioning body and turning them into just walking wooden dolls, taking away their once proud identity, and making them merge into a unification by force, a unification that doesn't even profit them for all that will happen to them is the continuation of years suffering, just when they were beginning to recover from their previous years of suffering by the hands of their sufferers, that ironically among many, also include the fuckers who pretend to liberate them from a pain that was actually a relief, and now that relief is termed pain and pain termed relief, the independent vocabulary of those people are gone, and now they are hollowed and chewed out until their 'liberators' have no more use for them.",
ACT_6_23.17,"For after that,",
ACT_6_23.18,"it would just be them utilizing the captured land that these people spent years cultivating,",
ACT_6_23.19,"and feeding it to the top few,",
ACT_6_23.20,whose fucking bellies aren't just filled yet with all the meat around the world...,
ACT_6_23.21,and you wanna know the worst part...',
ACT_6_24.1,'I am the one holding the fucking spoon that they feed from!,
ACT_6_24.2,"I am no fucking tragic hero,",
ACT_6_24.3,I am fucking villain.,
ACT_6_24.4,I am no one to feel sorry for.,
ACT_6_24.5,I....,
ACT_6_24.6,I do not...',
ACT_6_24.7,"At this point,",
ACT_6_24.8,"not knowing what I was doing or saying,",
ACT_6_24.9,"my hands were coming around in a tight-lock around my neck,",
ACT_6_24.10,even my body wished to choke the life out of me.,
ACT_6_24.11,"'Nobody has ever died from choking themselves by their own hands, if you wish to kill yourself try hanging from your own tie in your own fucking house, not in my shit-hole,'",
ACT_6_24.12,"her voice was straight and to the point, she wasn't lying about being only dizzy for a while.",
ACT_6_24.13,"The way she spoke, it didn't even feel like she had just taken drugs.",
ACT_6_24.14,"In fact, it felt like I was the one who was high.",
ACT_6_24.15,"After all, it was my eyes that were red from crying,",
ACT_6_24.16,"my breath that was losing its rhythm,",
ACT_6_24.17,and my brain that was melting away from the senses of logic.,
ACT_6_25.1,"'So-sorry,'",
ACT_6_25.2,"my hands relaxed, and suddenly she interlocked hers with mine.",
ACT_6_25.3,"'This will cost extra, but then you have the discount for serving the nation.",
ACT_6_25.4,100% fucking discount.,
ACT_6_25.5,"So, let's say if you were a regular one, not in a fucking police, army, or any other government uniform, just to say, holding your hand while you go full mental would've cost extra,'",
ACT_6_25.6,"she started stroking my hair and then letting go of that hateful tone that has suddenly burst out of her not long ago, she put back on that pretend loving voice of her and said,",
ACT_6_25.7,"'Anyway, go back to the girl.",
ACT_6_25.8,"Not gonna lie, as much and as frequently you lose the plot in your incoherent rambling,",
ACT_6_25.9,they always seem to be interesting stories that I both wish-and-not-wish to know.,
ACT_6_25.10,"I am not the curious type, that was a trait in someone I knew long ago,",
ACT_6_25.11,"but I still wish to know what’s the deal with the girl and that bloody friend of yours,",
ACT_6_25.12,"so let's resume,'",
ACT_6_25.13,"she came real close to my ears and whispered,",
ACT_6_25.14,'what happened to the girl and her mother?',
ACT_6_26.1,"'Well,'",
ACT_6_26.2,"It was really beginning to itch at my neck at that point, I was pressing my nails against the skin so hard that I feared I may accidentally tear open my skin,",
ACT_6_26.3,'W-we found the mother's dead body in a sewer nearby.,
ACT_6_26.4,"The body had no clothes on, and her entire body was covered in scratch marks, punch marks, and the entire jaw line was broken.",
ACT_6_26.5,"The gap was very small, and so her body was bent in a very weird shape and the skin was grinding against those walls.",
ACT_6_26.6,"When we were pulling out her dead body,",
ACT_6_26.7,"at one point her little finger grinded so much against the walls that the skin tore apart and the bone broke in the act,",
ACT_6_26.8,and we had to fetch the finger from the sewer later on while covering it up.',
ACT_6_27.1,'Covering it up?',
ACT_6_28.1,"'Yeah,",
ACT_6_28.2,"you see,",
ACT_6_28.3,it took no big brain detective to figure out what had happened to that girl's mother.,
ACT_6_28.4,"At that time I wasn't a captain, I was just a soldier among many.",
ACT_6_28.5,Ate the same food.,
ACT_6_28.6,Lived in the same bunk beds.,
ACT_6_28.7,"But most of all,",
ACT_6_28.8,I wore the same uniform.',
ACT_6_29.1,"'It wasn't me that she was trying to kill,",
ACT_6_29.2,it was my uniform.,
ACT_6_29.3,She was going to stab whoever wore the same dress as the one worn by the man who hurt her mother.,
ACT_6_29.4,"For whoever had done it, was one of us.",
ACT_6_29.5,"Nobody spoke a word then, but the way certain people in my camp acted, it was clear that they were either involved or knew who had done it.",
ACT_6_29.6,"I never figured out who it was, but just the day after we recovered the body of the mother,",
ACT_6_29.7,"I received the very first assignment of my life,",
ACT_6_29.8,which resulted in my very first promotion.,
ACT_6_29.9,And that assignment was...',
ACT_6_30.1,'...to hush up everything.,
ACT_6_30.2,"I, alongside a few of my fellow soldiers, were to make it look as if the girl and her mother never existed.",
ACT_6_30.3,"I was better at doing it than I expected, right now as that girl in that thought camp is just entering into her teenage years,",
ACT_6_30.4,she has no name or identity.,
ACT_6_30.5,"Whatever name she speaks of will not be in the legal records,",
ACT_6_30.6,and all she will ever be known as would be,
ACT_6_30.7,SUBJECT NO. 231.,
ACT_6_30.8,"You know,",
ACT_6_30.9,"after receiving the pay raise from that job,",
ACT_6_30.10,my father had patted my shoulder and said that I was finally becoming a man worthy to live my own life.,
ACT_6_30.11,A thing he had wanted for a long time.',
ACT_6_31.1,"'Okay,'",
ACT_6_31.2,"she started waving the cigarette in front of me,",
ACT_6_31.3,"'I need to keep your concentration in check, you have a tendency to mindlessly wander.",
ACT_6_31.4,We need to stick to the topic.,
ACT_6_31.5,So how does it correlate to that friend of yours?,
ACT_6_31.6,"Again,",
ACT_6_31.7,concentrate on the cigarette.',
ACT_6_32.1,"'So,",
ACT_6_32.2,"you know,",
ACT_6_32.3,"this guy and his eyes,",
ACT_6_32.4,"he has a gentle smile,",
ACT_6_32.5,but when his eyes get angry it is like they become creatures of their own.,
ACT_6_32.6,"I remember in training camp, I once told him that I was having doubts about this entire job.",
ACT_6_32.7,"I only joined the camp, because after a particular incident, my father wanted to make an honorable man out of me again.",
ACT_6_32.8,"Not honorable to be exact, he is not a big fan of this country or its rules, but he is a man who has made his fortune here.",
ACT_6_32.9,He knew the exact permutations and combinations one needed to follow to live a successful life here and get riches that you won't get in any other nation.,
ACT_6_32.10,"He wanted me to take this job because it was what was going to give me a comfortable life,",
ACT_6_32.11,or at least his idea of a comfortable life.',
ACT_6_33.1,"I was reminded by the waving cigarette that I was going off-topic again, and that I needed to get back on the track,",
ACT_6_33.2,"'So, I tell the guy that I don't feel like doing it. That I did not have it in me to take a life, and so this guy, I expected him to retaliate with some honorable speech on why one must serve its nation till the end of their life, but instead,",
ACT_6_33.3,"he grabbed my wrist, and twisted it.",
ACT_6_33.4,"I know by my build you may not think that I would be hurt by something as menial as an arm twist, but I can assure you, it was painful the way he twisted it.",
ACT_6_33.5,"He would dig his thumb deep in me,",
ACT_6_33.6,"I could actually feel my nerves getting blocked, including any and all blood supply to my hand.'",
ACT_6_34.1,'A-a-and he...',
ACT_6_34.2,"just imagining his face was giving me terrible shivers,",
ACT_6_34.3,"'he looked into my eyes, and...and the weird part is...the...the.....the weird part was that his voice was still friendly. Still as if some part of him believed he was a good honest man, a gentle man, who wouldn't....'",
ACT_6_35.1,'...who wouldn't even hurt a fly.',
ACT_6_36.1,"'But his actions,",
ACT_6_36.2,"the way he twisted my arm,",
ACT_6_36.3,"and looked at me with those scary eyes,",
ACT_6_36.4,I was convinced he was going to take my life then and there.,
ACT_6_36.5,"He didn't say anything, he just stared until I spoke,",
ACT_6_36.6,"'but I still love my country, so I will keep my thoughts aside and serve my motherland'.",
ACT_6_36.7,At that point....',
ACT_6_36.8,I suddenly choked on my words.,
ACT_6_36.9,It was a dizzy hot day.,
ACT_6_36.10,"I felt like taking my clothes off all over again, but was unable to find the strength to do so.",
ACT_6_36.11,All I could do was just lay still and continue to stare at the waving cigarette.,
ACT_6_36.12,"'S-so...at that point,",
ACT_6_36.13,"he let go of my wrist,",
ACT_6_36.14,"and returned to that friendly voice of his,",
ACT_6_36.15,"and said,",
ACT_6_36.16,'Glad to see that you are even more passionate than me.,
ACT_6_36.17,I can only aspire to be a soldier like you!',
ACT_6_37.1,"'I went to his house with my wife once,",
ACT_6_37.2,"and his wife,",
ACT_6_37.3,"I tell you,",
ACT_6_37.4,that guy's wife might as well be a doll.,
ACT_6_37.5,"She had no life to her,",
ACT_6_37.6,to every word she would just nod or respond with a whimpering voice.,
ACT_6_37.7,"And yet,",
ACT_6_37.8,he spoke of his wife as if she was the perfect [i]Yhafian[/i] woman.,
ACT_6_37.9,Like the ones we see on the poster.,
ACT_6_37.10,At one point during the dinner I caught her eyes staring outside the window.,
ACT_6_37.11,I didn't know what she was looking at:,
ACT_6_37.12,stars?,
ACT_6_37.13,clouds?,
ACT_6_37.14,moons?,
ACT_6_38.1,"Whatever she was looking at, one thing was clear,",
ACT_6_38.2,she carried this unspeakable sadness that was killing her by each passing second.,
ACT_6_38.3,"Even when the bitch I call my wife attempted to talk to her about some religious stuff she believes in,",
ACT_6_38.4,the girl was just a quivering mess.,
ACT_6_38.5,"During the car ride home, my wife was constantly making fun of her.",
ACT_6_38.6,Saying that my friend had a wet cat for a wife.',
ACT_6_39.1,"'You know,",
ACT_6_39.2,"what this stuff about eyes and shit remind me of,'",
ACT_6_39.3,"she interrupted and threw the cigarette on the side of the room,",
ACT_6_39.4,"'It reminds me of a quote from that author, the ones you guys executed five years ago for traitorous behavior, because he kept writing about [i]Conferri[/i] freedom and still called himself publicly a [i]Conferri[/i].",
ACT_6_39.5,What was his name...',
ACT_6_39.6,"as if trying to fix a television, she constantly hit her forehead before she finally remembered,",
ACT_6_39.7,"'AH,",
ACT_6_39.8,YES!,
ACT_6_39.9,Ermana Hifefi!,
ACT_6_39.10,"I used to read a lot of shit written by him before his death, you know he wrote a satirical pamphlet, it was called",
ACT_6_39.11,[i]SIMPLE GUIDE TO BEING YHAFA'S BRAVE SOLDIER[/i].,
ACT_6_39.12,"At one point in that pamphlet, there was a section about executing civilians.",
ACT_6_39.13,You know what he said there...',
ACT_6_40.1,'What?',
ACT_6_40.2,"I personally had never read anything by Ermana Hifefi, but that name reminded me of someone who used to love his readings a lot.",
ACT_6_41.1,"'So,'",
ACT_6_41.2,"she adjusted herself on the bed further, snapping herself a little away from me.",
ACT_6_41.3,"It looked like the heat had gotten to her as well, for she was in no mood of sticking herself closer to me and comforting me beyond the regular duties.",
ACT_6_41.4,"I didn't mind, I could've used as much of the open air as possible.",
ACT_6_41.5,'In that section of the pamphlet Ermana was brutal in roasting the [i]Yhafian[/i] army.,
ACT_6_41.6,"He would talk about how before executing civilians, you should chop the tip of your penis for good luck,",
ACT_6_41.7,and that to always make sure to grind your beard against the splinter-filled wood where your subject would be tied to.,
ACT_6_41.8,"So that if any splinter stabbed your cheeks, it would be a good sign that the execution will go smoothly,",
ACT_6_41.9,for the woods related to yada...yada.,
ACT_6_41.10,"To be honest, I don't remember what joke he made there, but it was his final line,",
ACT_6_41.11,the very final line,
ACT_6_41.12,that was about executing the people themselves that is still stuck in my mind till this day.',
ACT_6_42.1,'It went like this:,
ACT_6_42.2,"When taking the life of innocents,",
ACT_6_42.3,"make sure to look at the begging, crying, and screams of their mouth,",
ACT_6_42.4,and never at,
ACT_6_42.5,the whisper in their eyes.',
ACT_6_43.1,"'That way you will only celebrate what you did,",
ACT_6_43.2,and never feel guilty about what you have done.',
ACT_6_44.1,"'Sounds deep,' I spoke blankly.",
ACT_6_45.1,"'Well,'",
ACT_6_45.2,"she suddenly gulped before continuing,",
ACT_6_45.3,'he followed that with a poop joke.,
ACT_6_45.4,He-he.,
ACT_6_45.5,"Not gonna lie,",
ACT_6_45.6,"if he wasn't the only one speaking out, and if it was just normal fiction in a perfect world, where thousand voices like his wrote, spoke, and composed songs like that, it wouldn't even be received that well.",
ACT_6_45.7,"Many would probably call his entire comedic pamphlet poorly paced, or the placements of the jokes uneven, but when he is the only one writing stuff like that, somehow finding channels and sources to get his words door-to-door to everyone who long ago thought that they lost their fucking voices.",
ACT_6_45.8,"When that is a thing, even his mediocre writing became something special.",
ACT_6_45.9,"You know, he inspired Gigi to write.",
ACT_6_45.10,Wanna know the worst part?,
ACT_6_45.11,She was a thousand times better than Ermana in writing.,
ACT_6_45.12,"She wrote just menial, everyday, stories set in a modern day [i]Conferri[/i].",
ACT_6_45.13,"Like the stories won't be anything special, just simple stuff like an old woman running into her best friend from high school that she hadn't met in fifty years,",
ACT_6_45.14,"or two boys playing with marbles and suddenly having one of them being stolen by a ferret,",
ACT_6_45.15,and now the two boys run around the town in this comical chase scene...',
ACT_6_45.16,"A giggle escaped her at this point, whatever she was describing might have been really funny, it almost made me wish to read it myself,",
ACT_6_45.17,"maybe it would've made me smile too,",
ACT_6_45.18,"but I didn't bother asking if her manuscript was still lying around,",
ACT_6_45.19,"for I could tell what was coming next,",
ACT_6_46.1,"'...at one point during the chase, the bigger boy jumps across a small sewer canal, and asks the little boy,",
ACT_6_46.2,'Can you jump?',
ACT_6_46.3,Now what he meant was 'Can you jump across the canal?',
ACT_6_46.4,but the little boy misinterprets it as 'Can you jump in the canal?',
ACT_6_46.5,"and so the little shit just jumps into the canal, gets his shoes and pants dirty, and then looking above with a smile he says,",
ACT_6_46.6,"'Look I DID IT!', he-he. '",
ACT_6_47.1,"The way she described it, it didn't sound very funny to me, but maybe the way it was written would've changed my mind,",
ACT_6_47.2,"'It was all simple stuff like that, but with one exception,",
ACT_6_47.3,all of it would be set in [i]Conferri[/i] that was never invaded.,
ACT_6_47.4,"Just normal,",
ACT_6_47.5,"peaceful,",
ACT_6_47.6,"life of a group of people living in their own freedom and defining it their own way,'",
ACT_6_47.7,"her giggles transformed into a neutral voice as she continued the entire thing about Gigi with,",
ACT_6_47.8,"'when they found that manuscript in her wardrobe and read it, they cut her little toe for it and fed it to whatever crow that the master keeps for a pet,'",
ACT_6_47.9,"total silence fell as she concluded with,",
ACT_6_47.10,'that was three days before she jumped by the way.',
ACT_6_48.1,"'So,",
ACT_6_48.2,"anyway,",
ACT_6_48.3,how do you do it?',
ACT_6_48.4,she finally fell out of the same lost thoughts she was criticizing with her cigarette waving not long ago.,
ACT_6_49.1,'The mask thing I so metaphorically bitched about?',
ACT_6_49.2,"someone,",
ACT_6_49.3,somewhere needed to do something about the heat.,
ACT_6_49.4,"It was rather too hot, and for some reason,",
ACT_6_49.5,it felt difficult to breathe in that rising temperature.,
ACT_6_50.1,"'Well,",
ACT_6_50.2,"you form a character,",
ACT_6_50.3,and you consistently play that character.,
ACT_6_50.4,"My character being a no nonsense captain who talks in curses,",
ACT_6_50.5,"is a womanizer,",
ACT_6_50.6,but gets the job done at the end of the day.,
ACT_6_50.7,"Forming shit-sounding words are very simple,",
ACT_6_50.8,just make sure to mock everything inhumanly as you could. Total movie shit.',
ACT_6_50.9,"'Haha, that part was in Hefifi's pamphlet.'",
ACT_6_51.1,"'So yeah, my character would be tough on his men, but would always reward them for their loyalty with good things.",
ACT_6_51.2,"At first it was a little empowering,",
ACT_6_51.3,"for every time I was on the phone with that 'best friend' I talked about, I would be able to scream and shout at him, make myself feel more important than him.",
ACT_6_51.4,"But, then I would hear his grunting noises.",
ACT_6_51.5,"You know whenever he is holding the telephone, he grunts like a madman when things don't go his way.",
ACT_6_51.6,"You may as well, for once, face the general to the edge of him screaming like a madman, but you don't wanna do that with this guy, I tell you.",
ACT_6_51.7,"At one point, he was talking about going by the book or something when it came to executing the student leaders, and I told him to refer to the general, because I very well knew that if I heard his grunting more, I would go mad.",
ACT_6_51.8,"After the general made him believe whatever the fuck he wanted to make him believe, that man was calm as sea again.",
ACT_6_51.9,"For I don't know what metaphor or saying the general used, but he sounded no longer concerned with the execution. Just the way his breath changed, one could not pinpoint when he would lash out, and this is coming from someone who has never seen his full anger.' ",
ACT_6_51.10,"Talking about that man was becoming heavier on me by every passing second,",
ACT_6_51.11,"so,",
ACT_6_51.12,"just to calm my anxieites,",
ACT_6_51.13,I decided to switch the topic out of nowhere.,
ACT_6_52.1,"'Say, don't you [i]Conferris[/i] have that god of vengeance or something, why don't you all pray to it and ask him to kill us all at once? Would save a lot more suffering,'",
ACT_6_52.2,"here was the part that I did not wish to mock, I genuinely wanted some god to just descend down, take my life, and be done with this shit, but with the blunt tone of my voice, I wouldn't be surprised if she found it mocking.",
ACT_6_53.1,"'Well,'",
ACT_6_53.2,"her eyes were now completely fixated on the fan,",
ACT_6_53.3,"'we have many like that who have stories where they take vengeance for the suffering innocent man, but I know the one you are talking about,",
ACT_6_53.4,Ketuk,
ACT_6_53.5,"or as they pronounced it in the north part of [i]Conferri[/i] before invasion,",
ACT_6_53.6,Kutek.,
ACT_6_53.7,"Both are valid way to pronounce,",
ACT_6_53.8,my side called him [i]Ketuk[/i] though.',
ACT_6_54.1,"'Yeah, what about him?'",
ACT_6_55.1,"'About him,",
ACT_6_55.2,"is the fact that [i]Ketuk[/i] is not a god who is calculating or sane by any means,",
ACT_6_55.3,"it lives and thrives into the insanity of its subjects,",
ACT_6_55.4,whether they be the ones praying for him or fearing him.,
ACT_6_55.5,"[i]Ketuk[/i] is not just,",
ACT_6_55.6,"for a just god would only kill the perpetrators,",
ACT_6_55.7,and not the innocent people around him.,
ACT_6_55.8,"[i]Ketuk[/i] just needs a direction,",
ACT_6_55.9,"and then it will first,",
ACT_6_55.10,"mark every innocent or non-innocent in that direction and drain them of their sanity,",
ACT_6_55.11,and then it will kill them in the most violent way possible.,
ACT_6_55.12,"Bitch only comes out from a 7 year sleep anyway, and nobody knows when he will awaken,",
ACT_6_55.13,"and when he does,",
ACT_6_55.14,whoever is the first to pray to him gets his favor.,
ACT_6_55.15,"Though,",
ACT_6_55.16,"once he is used,",
ACT_6_55.17,"it won't solve any larger problems,",
ACT_6_55.18,"for he will take the sanity and lives of just a few,",
ACT_6_55.19,"call it a day,",
ACT_6_55.20,and then disappear as if it accomplished anything.,
ACT_6_55.21,"They pretended as if [i]Ketuk[/i] killing a few people in the direction of people you hate would solve anything,",
ACT_6_55.22,but all it has ever led to was more misery.,
ACT_6_55.23,For conflicts would arise over the deaths committed.,
ACT_6_55.24,"That shit piece of a god takes a price every time it is used, and they say that price is usually one mind.",
ACT_6_55.25,"Whenever someone committed suicide, there were rituals held in case that person,",
ACT_6_55.26,"by any means,",
ACT_6_55.27,prayed to [i]Ketuk[/i] to kill someone.',
ACT_6_56.1,'What if a dying person prayed to him?',
ACT_6_57.1,"'Well,",
ACT_6_57.2,they say [i]Ketuk[/i] would keep their soul and use them as his minions.,
ACT_6_57.3,Never letting them reincarnate and keeping them locked in an infinite cycle of madness.,
ACT_6_57.4,The bottom line is:,
ACT_6_57.5,Ketuk,
ACT_6_57.6,"has never solved a problem,",
ACT_6_57.7,only made it worse.,
ACT_6_57.8,Nobody prays to that false god unless they have gone completely insane,
ACT_6_57.9,or...',
ACT_6_58.1,"'They have lost all faith in the world,",
ACT_6_58.2,"and just wish someone to suffer the same way that they did,'",
ACT_6_58.3,I completed her words for her.,
ACT_6_58.4,"'You seem knowledgeable on the topic,'",
ACT_6_58.5,just the irritation of her voice communicated to me that she felt like I wasted her time scouting out the information for this god of theirs.,
ACT_6_58.6,"'It's not like that, I did not know the finer details, but the final part of it, I could predict.",
ACT_6_58.7,"You know, I have pretended for long that I don't fear the grudges of those that I wronged,",
ACT_6_58.8,"but the truth is,",
ACT_6_58.9,"every time I take a life, for a night or two I would wonder, if that dying grudge has somehow taken a form or shape,",
ACT_6_58.10,"and that shape is just now limping towards me, getting closer...'",
ACT_6_58.11,"I felt my breathing getting heavier, this place was rotten,",
ACT_6_58.12,'...and closer...',
ACT_6_58.13,"I was finding it hard to breathe,",
ACT_6_58.14,"for some reason,",
ACT_6_58.15,"it felt like my skin was melting,",
ACT_6_58.16,"'...and closer,",
ACT_6_58.17,"before it will get me,",
ACT_6_58.18,and make me suffer the same violence I performed on someone else.',
ACT_6_59.1,"'I think it is the fifth time you have bitched about wishing to die,'",
ACT_6_59.2,"her voice snapped me out again,",
ACT_6_59.3,"'in case you want, I can stab you with an ice-pick.",
ACT_6_59.4,"I am not as soft-hearted or rosy or optimistic like Gigi, who will cry over for anyone or everyone.",
ACT_6_59.5,"I can do it, and maybe when I kill you, they will kill me for killing you.",
ACT_6_59.6,"Then, we both will be free of this madness.",
ACT_6_59.7,"Say, wanna try?'",
ACT_6_59.8,"Any veneer of her pretending to like me had shed, she had seen beyond my tough face to know that I was nothing but a weak man who can only cry about himself.",
ACT_6_59.9,"Even if I was a paying man, she wouldn't have cared.",
ACT_6_59.10,"She was speaking the truth that she felt inside, either to kill me or by any certain chain of events, to find an excuse to take out all her frustration before she killed herself.",
ACT_6_59.11,"Maybe if it was a terrible enough day,",
ACT_6_59.12,I would have taken her reprimands to my ears and screamed,
ACT_6_59.13,JUST DO IT,
ACT_6_59.14,to her face.,
ACT_6_59.15,"Though that day,",
ACT_6_59.16,"for some reason,",
ACT_6_59.17,"despite the weather,",
ACT_6_59.18,"despite the edge I was at,",
ACT_6_59.19,"constantly wishing for the fan to fall and take my life,",
ACT_6_59.20,"my body was still living in that walking contradiction that I was,",
ACT_6_59.21,"for I could only mutter,",
ACT_6_59.22,'maybe next day.',
ACT_6_60.1,"Suddenly, her voice turned loving again and she spoke,",
ACT_6_60.2,"'Oh, well, I will be waiting for it.",
ACT_6_60.3,"Say, can you answer another question that I had?",

ACT_6_65.4,I had very little sympathy for myself.,
ACT_6_65.5,"I was an empty shell with no emotions, by that time it was probably more than half a decade since it happened,",

ACT_6_66.5,that someone approached me...',
ACT_6_67.1,'Chio?',

ACT_6_68.2,it was someone else from the union.,
ACT_6_68.3,"A boy not long in height, and his voice was very weak and almost girlish,",

ACT_6_68.5,Could've been an actor in a better world.',
ACT_6_69.1,"'So he approached me,",
ACT_6_69.2,"thinking that I might be a [i]Conferri[/i] and asked me if I too felt it annoying to have to chant the names and prayers of their oppressors every day,",
ACT_6_69.3,while their own identity was eradicated slowly but surely.,
ACT_6_69.4,"I was like,",
ACT_6_69.5,"whatever,",
ACT_6_69.6,"and attempted to get away from his annoying ass, but then he just grabbed my shoulder and asked me if I really wanted to live as miserably as that forever,",

ACT_6_70.1,'Did that work?',
ACT_6_71.1,"'Nope,",

ACT_6_72.6,"the coin landed upright,'",
ACT_6_72.7,"Her mouth was giggling,",

ACT_6_72.9,"I could tell that perhaps,",
ACT_6_72.10,"just like me,",
ACT_6_72.11,she was thinking of someone as well.,
ACT_6_73.1,"'Anyway,",
ACT_6_73.2,"so she walks to me,",
ACT_6_73.3,"and maybe it was just the fucking puberty,",
ACT_6_73.4,but I was speechless when I saw her.,

ACT_6_74.4,"So she comes to me and asks me if I could just give her five minutes to hear what they had to say,",
ACT_6_74.5,and so I did.,

ACT_6_78.5,and I lived alone with my mother.,

ACT_6_78.7,it was violent.,
ACT_6_78.8,"I still ate at the same fucking table where my father took my mother's life,",
ACT_6_78.9,"so,",
ACT_6_78.10,it was also kind of fucked up.,
ACT_6_78.11,"I feared that they would all think I was crazy or like my father,",
ACT_6_78.12,so I told them that fake story.',
ACT_6_79.1,"'After I joined their group, some of them at times even offered to accompany me to my home,",

ACT_6_81.2,"I was afraid if I ever let them know who I truly was,",
ACT_6_81.3,they would abandon me like everything and everyone that had already abandoned me so far.,

ACT_6_81.5,"At first,",

ACT_6_88.17,"A team of eight would be made, and both presidents would walk in between to hug each other and the competition would begin.",
ACT_6_88.18,"The judges would come from afar, and so there would be no bias,",
