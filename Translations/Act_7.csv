ACT_7_TITLE,ACT SEVEN: An Ending,
ACT_7_1.1,"For the next few days, I felt my health decline further and further.",
ACT_7_1.2,"I was barely getting any sleep, even revisiting brothels didn't work.",
ACT_7_1.3,"The girl I talked and gifted that locket to, didn’t want to see me.",
ACT_7_1.4,That much was clear.,
ACT_7_1.5,"She would rather take different men to her room, and the entire time as she took them away, she stare at me sideways with her red eyes.",
ACT_7_1.6,"At first I was confused if she was regularly crying or doing a lot more drugs,",
ACT_7_1.7,"however,",
ACT_7_1.8,after two or three times this happened that I realized...,
ACT_7_2.1,...it was a bit of both.,
ACT_7_3.1,"The only thing new I noticed about her the last time I visited the brothel,",
ACT_7_3.2,"was when she was wearing a black backless maxi dress (clearly a courtesy of some regular customer) and there was a tattoo of [i]Conferri[/i] god,",
ACT_7_3.3,Augmera,
ACT_7_3.4,(the goddess of prosperous marriage),
ACT_7_3.5,"on the back of her shoulder,",
ACT_7_3.6,"at the bottom of which was another tattoo, that of the planet Venus.",
ACT_7_3.7,I funnily never noticed these tattoos when I was with her in bed.,
ACT_7_3.8,"I was always so focused on the front,",
ACT_7_3.9,"so focused on crying,",
ACT_7_3.10,that I never even checked the back.,
ACT_7_3.11,If I did then I would've get that...,
ACT_7_4.1,...she was married once.,
ACT_7_5.1,"Seeing that I realized something I already somewhat knew and even spoke about before,",
ACT_7_5.2,"that my confessions,",
ACT_7_5.3,they had meant nothing.,
ACT_7_5.4,For they changed nothing about what I did every day.,
ACT_7_5.5,"It had not cleansed my soul,",
ACT_7_5.6,it had only solidified its dirt further and further.,
ACT_7_5.7,"You can at once forgive a man who didn't know what he was doing was wrong,",
ACT_7_5.8,but there was no saving the man who did things knowing they were wrong.,
ACT_7_5.9,I was worse than what some called the lowest scums of the earth.,
ACT_7_6.1,I was a [color=red]monster[/color].,
ACT_7_7.1,"On the fourth day,",
ACT_7_7.2,I got a call from the higher office.,
ACT_7_7.3,"It was the acting general who had been seated in wake of the old general's disappearance, and he had an immediate order for me.",
ACT_7_7.4,The order was to go to Ronan Isidro's house and drag him out if necessary.,
ACT_7_7.5,"They had been trying to contact him for a few days, but he was unresponsive.",
ACT_7_7.6,"Apparently, an investigation was launched into the death of Seiko and Isamu, and a lot had been uncovered, including Ronan apparently playing a part in covering up his death.",
ACT_7_7.7,"Isamu,",
ACT_7_7.8,"as it turned out,",
ACT_7_7.9,had not died protecting Seiko's honor.,
ACT_7_7.10,"He had died from exhaustion,",
ACT_7_7.11,a heart attack took his life immediately –,
ACT_7_7.12,a sign of weakness.,
ACT_7_7.13,"Worst part was, the word leaked to foreign sources and they were already reporting on it worldwide.",
ACT_7_7.14,"The acting general believed that I was Ronan's best friend, as the word got around.",
ACT_7_7.15,He said that he believed that I could bring him in without much fuss and without wasting men who were needed in desperate places –,
ACT_7_7.16,"aka, the places where rebellions were starting to rise.",
ACT_7_7.17,"I was free to bring two men if I wished, but I refused.",
ACT_7_7.18,I told him that I could bring him in alone.,
ACT_7_7.19,Told them that he was a reasonable man.,
ACT_7_7.20,Told them that he was not a violent man.,
ACT_7_7.21,All lies to keep the mask on.,
ACT_7_8.1,"And so that is how,",
ACT_7_8.2,"after taking a long train ride where I struggled to fall asleep,",
ACT_7_8.3,after constant noises and breaths haunted my ears...,
ACT_7_9.1,I ended up outside his house.,
ACT_7_10.1,"'It's terrible weather, officer,'",
ACT_7_10.2,"A very quiet,",
ACT_7_10.3,"well-spoken voice said from behind me,",
ACT_7_10.4,'you should get inside.',
ACT_7_10.5,I turned around to see a man standing in the middle of rain.,
ACT_7_10.6,"He had a nice form to him,",
ACT_7_10.7,an even stronger form than me to be honest.,
ACT_7_10.8,"He was holding a notepad in his right hand and a pen in his left,",
ACT_7_10.9,"'I had been trying to reach Officer Isidro for days now, but he just doesn't answer the door.",
ACT_7_10.10,Is it true what they say about him?',
ACT_7_11.1,"Suddenly,",
ACT_7_11.2,"a running man passed us by,",
ACT_7_11.3,"and looking at the other man he screamed,",
ACT_7_11.4,"'Get inside, it is going to storm today!'",
ACT_7_11.5,"and then as his eyes fell upon me,",
ACT_7_11.6,"he suddenly became still,",
ACT_7_11.7,"saluted me in an awkward stance,",
ACT_7_11.8,"and said,",
ACT_7_11.9,'Love to [i]Yhafa[/i] sir! Thanks for your duty to our great nation!',
ACT_7_11.10,and quickly ran out of that place.,
ACT_7_12.1,"'I am in no mood of giving any answers,'",
ACT_7_12.2,I told the man with the notepad in a strict voice.,
ACT_7_12.3,"'Oh then,'",
ACT_7_12.4,"his voice suddenly became calm,",
ACT_7_12.5,'I'll get them later.',
ACT_7_13.1,"For a while I stood there,",
ACT_7_13.2,"and when I didn't hear any noise of feet splashing against the puddles on the road,",
ACT_7_13.3,"I had a feeling that he was still standing there,",
ACT_7_13.4,"I turned around and said,",
ACT_7_13.5,"'Look, you leave me alone or...'",
ACT_7_13.6,"But before I could say anything,",
ACT_7_13.7,I noticed that he wasn't actually standing there.,
ACT_7_13.8,Nobody was.,
ACT_7_13.9,That man was truly not there.,
ACT_7_13.10,"Weird,",
ACT_7_13.11,"I thought to myself,",
ACT_7_13.12,for I never heard his footsteps walk away.,
ACT_7_14.1,"I walked to Ronan's door, and banged on the door.",
ACT_7_15.1,And to my surprise...,
ACT_7_16.1,...the door was open.,
ACT_7_17.1,"And as soon as I entered, this terrible feeling overcame me.",
ACT_7_17.2,"It told me to turn back,",
ACT_7_17.3,for what laid ahead was not something that would let me live.,
ACT_7_17.4,"I wanted to go,",
ACT_7_17.5,"my entire body was suddenly shivering,",
ACT_7_17.6,"and it hasn't even been a second,",
ACT_7_17.7,but I could feel all the life draining out of my body.,
ACT_7_18.1,The door shut behind me.,
ACT_7_18.2,I turned around and tried to open it...,
ACT_7_19.1,...but it was locked.,
ACT_7_20.1,"The living room looked normal,",
ACT_7_20.2,but something told me that it didn’t look like how it was supposed to look like.,
ACT_7_20.3,For when I walked...,
ACT_7_21.1,A shard of glass stabbed my right foot.,
ACT_7_21.2,It was so sharp that it pierced through my boots and stabbed me all the way into my ankles.,
ACT_7_21.3,"I took it out, and felt a terrible pain rush through my entire foot.",
ACT_7_21.4,"I almost wanted to remove my boots and see the place stabbed,",
ACT_7_21.5,"but all I could do was scream,",
ACT_7_21.6,'Ronan!',
ACT_7_21.7,at the top of my voice.,
ACT_7_21.8,"No response ever came and all that happened was my voice echoed through that place with no response in sight,",
ACT_7_21.9,except for,
ACT_7_21.10,a whisper in my ear.,
ACT_7_22.1,"It was telling me to step away,",
ACT_7_22.2,but all I did was step forward with careful steps.,
ACT_7_23.1,"The ground looked clean,",
ACT_7_23.2,but it was clear to me that it was not as clean as it looked.,
ACT_7_23.3,"My eyes were not good,",
ACT_7_23.4,and an instinct told me that all of this was [b]not[/b] a result of my lack of sleep.,
ACT_7_24.1,"The kitchen was empty,",
ACT_7_24.2,"the dishes left unclean,",
ACT_7_24.3,"and flies of death buzzed around that place,",
ACT_7_24.4,"and as I was turning back from the kitchen,",
ACT_7_24.5,"and moving back into the living room,",
ACT_7_24.6,when suddenly...,
ACT_7_25.1,I was suddenly not in the living room anymore.,
ACT_7_25.2,It was a hallway...,
ACT_7_25.3,no it was...,
ACT_7_26.1,...a cave.,
ACT_7_27.1,"I wished to be shocked,",
ACT_7_27.2,but something made me think that this was...,
ACT_7_27.3,"somehow,",
ACT_7_27.4,just a natural chain of events.,
ACT_7_27.5,That I was always supposed to land here one day.,
ACT_7_28.1,"Noise came from a direction,",
ACT_7_28.2,it was the screams of a man in terrible pain.,
ACT_7_28.3,I walked forward in that cave...,
ACT_7_29.1,"...not trying to make any noise,",
ACT_7_29.2,or touch its walls.,
ACT_7_29.3,"They were made of real flesh,",
ACT_7_29.4,for they too shivered every time I touched.,
ACT_7_30.1,"I followed that noise,",
ACT_7_30.2,and felt my heart race faster.,
ACT_7_30.3,"Something really bad was going to happen to me,",
ACT_7_30.4,and I was walking right into it.,
ACT_7_31.1,"Soon,",
ACT_7_31.2,I reached the door and it opened on its own.,
ACT_7_31.3,"I entered without saying much,",
ACT_7_31.4,"and soon,",
ACT_7_31.5,I was greeted to...,
ACT_7_32.1,A sight that was not human.,
ACT_7_32.2,"Inhuman figures stood by the bedside, and I could hear their cries.",
ACT_7_32.3,"They were in terrible pain, but were unable to express for themselves outside of those screams.",
ACT_7_32.4,They were incapable of forming human words and tell what the problem was.,
ACT_7_32.5,What the cause of the pain was.,
ACT_7_32.6,"I should've been scared,",
ACT_7_32.7,"I should've tried to run away,",
ACT_7_32.8,"or stabbed myself dead in the madness of seeing something that should not,",
ACT_7_32.9,by all means,
ACT_7_32.10,"exist,",
ACT_7_32.11,but all I could do was stare down....,
ACT_7_33.1,...at that photograph.,
ACT_7_34.1,He.,
ACT_7_34.2,He.,
ACT_7_34.3,It was a photo of everyone I knew.,
ACT_7_34.4,"Seven figures stood on the left,",
ACT_7_34.5,long dead.,
ACT_7_34.6,"To the right of them stood four more figures,",
ACT_7_34.7,"the general,",
ACT_7_34.8,"Ronan's Wife,",
ACT_7_34.9,"A Baby In Her Arms,",
ACT_7_34.10,and....,
ACT_7_35.1,...Ronan himself.,
ACT_7_36.1,Ha.,
ACT_7_36.2,Ha.,
ACT_7_36.3,"It was a wonderful thing that I held it in my hand,",
ACT_7_36.4,for I knew...,
ACT_7_36.5,"FOR I KNEW,",
ACT_7_36.6,that it was impossible for the photograph to exist this way.,
ACT_7_36.7,There was no way that this could exist.,
ACT_7_36.8,NO.,
ACT_7_36.9,NO.,
ACT_7_36.10,NO!!!,
ACT_7_36.11,It was impossible!,
ACT_7_36.12,It cannot!,
ACT_7_36.13,It cannot EXIST!,
ACT_7_36.14,THERE WAS NO WAY!,
ACT_7_37.1,Their painful moans continued to reverberate through the room.,
ACT_7_37.2,"I wanted to console them,",
ACT_7_37.3,but all I could do was shed a single tear for them.,
ACT_7_37.4,It was a painful sight.,
ACT_7_38.1,Cackle.,
ACT_7_38.2,Cackle.,
ACT_7_38.3,The noise of something cackled from above.,
ACT_7_39.1,"I looked above,",
ACT_7_39.2,and saw its face.,
ACT_7_40.1,"More laughing figures appeared beside me,",
ACT_7_40.2,but my eyes remain ever fixated on the figure that crawled above me.,
ACT_7_40.3,"Its eyes terribly fixated on me in joy,",
ACT_7_40.4,it was licking its long tongue in happiness.,
ACT_7_41.1,"And as I stared at it,",
ACT_7_41.2,"I felt my brain break apart,",
ACT_7_41.3,for it was such a horrible figure that I could not make sense of how it could exist.,
ACT_7_41.4,Nothing about it was natural.,
ACT_7_41.5,"Its movements,",
ACT_7_41.6,"noise,",
ACT_7_41.7,and its entire shape.,
ACT_7_41.8,Trying to make sense of it was heating my body and mind.,
ACT_7_41.9,There was no...,
ACT_7_41.10,NO POSSIBLE WAY...,
ACT_7_41.11,"that this thing could exist,",
ACT_7_41.12,"and yet,",
ACT_7_41.13,it was here.,
ACT_7_41.14,In front of me...,
ACT_7_41.15,"or more accurately,",
ACT_7_41.16,just well above me.,
ACT_7_42.1,I could see the violence and madness it craved from me.,
ACT_7_42.2,"It wished to kill me,",
ACT_7_42.3,but not by any quick means.,
ACT_7_42.4,It wanted to make me suffer till the end.,
ACT_7_42.5,"It wanted to rip apart every meat and bone that I possessed,",
ACT_7_42.6,"and just by its expressions,",
ACT_7_42.7,I could tell that it was going to extend that pain as long as it could.,
ACT_7_43.1,"As my mind broke,",
ACT_7_43.2,"and it extended its arm to grab me,",
ACT_7_43.3,"I wanted to scream,",
ACT_7_43.4,"shout,",
ACT_7_43.5,and struggle.,
ACT_7_43.6,"However,",
ACT_7_43.7,all that escaped me was a whisper.,
ACT_7_43.8,A,
ACT_7_43.9,whisper,
ACT_7_43.10,that,
ACT_7_43.11,said:,
ACT_7_44.1,THANK YOU.,
